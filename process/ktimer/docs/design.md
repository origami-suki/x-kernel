# ktimer design

## Purpose

`ktimer` owns the process-shared `setitimer` and POSIX timer state and
converts expirations into `TimerDelivery` values. `kprocess` embeds
`ProcessTimerManager` per process runtime, polls it from the user-return
path, converts deliveries into `ksignal` notifications, and registers the
dequeue-validation callback; `ksyscall` owns ABI parsing (timespec
conversion, `timer_create`/`settime` argument decode). Wall-clock wakeup is
provided by the crate's global alarm task.

## Scope

```

`TimerInstant` is a crate-internal closed set distinguishing realtime,
monotonic, boottime, and process-CPU clocks. `ITimer` stores a `TimeSpan`
interval and an `Option<TimerInstant>` deadline — never bare unitless
integers. POSIX timers reuse `ITimer` as their specification and add
notification and overrun state.

## Execution context

- `ProcessTimerManager` is serialized by the owning `ProcessRuntime`'s
  `Arc<Mutex<..>>` (`kprocess::process_runtime`). Its methods run on
  syscall and user-return paths; they do not sleep.
- `poll_cpu_timers` relies on caller-supplied sampled `TimeSpan` user and
  kernel CPU totals of the same process; CPU timers are pure polling, no
  interrupts.
- The alarm task (`spawn_alarm_task`) is a sleepable kernel task using
  `timeout_at` on the earliest `MonotonicInstant`; the expired-owner
  callback re-enters `kprocess` polling and may therefore block on the
  process runtime mutex.
- `register_expired_task_handler`/`spawn_alarm_task` are one-time
  bring-up calls.

## State machine

A disarmed timer has no deadline. Arming with a nonzero value enters the
armed state. On expiration a one-shot timer returns to disarmed; a
periodic timer advances from the *old* deadline by an integer number of
intervals (drift-free), saturating at the clock maximum. A non-
representable nonzero deadline is rejected with an error *before* any
state changes — it is never silently treated as a disarm request.
`settime` on a POSIX timer resets pending-signal and overrun state.

POSIX timer notifications add a generation counter (`signal_seq`), bumped
on every re-arm: a dequeued signal whose sequence no longer matches is
dropped by `on_timer_signal_dequeued`.

## Algorithms

- Missed-period advance: `skipped = overdue / interval + 1`; the deadline
  moves `skipped * interval` forward from the previous deadline, and the
  expiration count is clamped to `usize::MAX`.
- Overrun reporting: `queued_overrun` accumulates while a signal is
  pending; `last_overrun` is frozen only when that signal is dequeued
  (POSIX `timer_getoverrun` semantics); reads clamp to `i32::MAX`.
- Alarm queue: a `BinaryHeap` of `(MonotonicInstant, Pid)` ordered by
  deadline then pid; a new earliest deadline notifies the task via an
  `event_listener` Event; the task re-validates the head after waking to
  ignore spurious or stale wakeups. Realtime deadlines are converted to
  monotonic at enqueue time (`ktime::realtime_deadline_to_monotonic`), so
  the queue only ever holds monotonic deadlines.
- Timer ID allocation: monotonically increasing with wraparound at
  `i32::MAX` back to 1, skipping live IDs; exhaustion returns `EINVAL`.
  Signal sequences wrap to 1 on overflow.

## Concurrency

Per-process state is externally serialized by the runtime mutex. The
global alarm heap is a `ksync::Mutex`; heap push/peek/pop are short
critical sections. Stale heap entries (timer rearmed or deleted) are
harmless: the poll path re-reads timer state and the `signal_seq` filter
drops notifications from an older generation. Multiple enqueues for the
same timer are expected — each `arm_deadline` supersedes earlier entries
observationally, and the task re-checks the head deadline.

## Design decisions

- Deadlines across different clocks are an enum, not shared nanosecond
  scalars, so cross-domain comparisons surface as explicit mismatches
  (panics are confined to internal invariants, never user input).
- The alarm queue holds only monotonic instants; realtime conversion
  happens once at enqueue.
- `snapshot` receives the clock-domain "now" and returns interval and
  remaining `TimeSpan` only.
- `SIGEV_NONE` timers track expirations with no notification at all
  (overrun still counted).
- `set_posix_timer` may return an immediate delivery when the timer
  already expired at arm time, avoiding a lost first expiration.

## Resource lifecycle

Timers are created/deleted through the manager (`clear_posix_timers` on
exec). Heap entries carry only `(deadline, pid)` and are garbage-collected
by expiry or left harmless if stale; no explicit removal API exists.
`ProcessTimerManager` is dropped with its owning process runtime.
