# kidentity security and reliability

## Scope, assets, and boundaries

The whole crate (`src/lib.rs`) is covered. Assets are stable task identities,
namespace ancestry, and numeric projections consumed by process registries.
Trusted callers supply namespace handles and fixed root numbers. There is no
direct user-pointer, filesystem, network, MMIO, DMA, firmware, FFI, or assembly
input. `kprocess`/task lifecycle owners are responsible for authorization and
publication before runnable state.

## Unsafe inventory and invariants

There is no unsafe code. Every `Upid` owns a live namespace reference. Public
constructors create an acyclic parent chain and a root projection in every
handle. `root_nr` relies on that projection. Namespace identity comparison is
pointer-based except for the documented root fallback. A fixed number is not a
unique allocation guarantee.

## Thread safety

`AtomicU32` serializes per-namespace allocation. Immutable `Arc` graphs and
vectors need no further internal locks. Allocation across several namespaces is
not an atomic transaction: a failure leaves earlier counter increments consumed.
`LazyInit` publishes the global root once, independently of task publication.

## Threat analysis

| ID | Threat and asset | Severity | Trigger | Response and residual risk |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| T-01 | Identity exhaustion | Medium | Repeated allocations reach the counter bound | Checked increment returns `WouldBlock`; no wrap, reuse, rollback, or reclamation exists. |
| T-02 | Duplicate numeric registration | High | Trusted caller uses `fixed_root` for an already allocated number | Fixed projections are explicitly unchecked; registry owners must enforce uniqueness and stable identity, not rely on this constructor. |
| T-03 | Wrong namespace visibility decision | High | Caller interprets root fallback as namespace equality | `nr_in` documents fallback for any root; non-root misses return `None`. Authorization must use the actual namespace policy. |
| T-04 | Unstable visible task identity | Medium | Upper layer makes task runnable before publication | Upper-layer lifecycle must publish first; this allocator does not implement that transaction. |
| T-05 | Excessive namespace nesting | Medium | Trusted callers repeatedly construct children | No depth cap is enforced; allocation/lookup cost and parent-drop depth increase, and `level + 1` can overflow. Callers must bound nesting. |

## Failure modes and effects (FMEA)

| ID | Failure mode | Cause | Local effect | System effect | Severity (1-4) | Handling |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| F-01 | Number exhaustion | Counter at `u32::MAX` | `WouldBlock` | New task creation fails | 3 | Propagate error; consumed descendant numbers are retained. |
| F-02 | Missing root projection | Broken internal constructor invariant | `root_nr` panics | Kernel service fails | 2 | Constructors always append root or create a root-only handle. |
| F-03 | Premature root allocation | Linux-visible task created before init | First number consumed | Init's PID-1 check can fail | 2 | Boot lifecycle controls allocation order. |
| F-04 | Allocation/depth failure | Heap exhaustion or excessive nesting | Allocation failure or overflow behavior | Process creation unavailable | 2 | External resource/depth policy; no local recovery. |

## Failure handling, privacy, and limitations

Recoverable number failures use `KResult`; namespace misses use `Option`.
The global-root `unwrap` relies on completed `call_once`. No retry or reclaim
exists. The crate stores numeric process metadata and namespace relationships,
not user payload, and writes no logs. Upper layers must authorize exposing that
metadata. Lack of reuse, linear namespace lookup, unchecked fixed projections,
and root fallback are deliberate/current constraints, not full isolation claims.

## Audit checklist

- Keep checked per-namespace increments and root projections.
- Verify external uniqueness for `fixed_root` callers.
- Preserve publish-before-runnable ordering in task owners.
- Do not conflate root fallback with pointer identity or authorization.
- Reassess retained identities before introducing PID reuse.
