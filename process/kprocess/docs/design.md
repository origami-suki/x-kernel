# kprocess — Design

## Purpose and ownership

`kprocess` owns the process domain: stable process/thread identity bindings,
parent-child and group/session relations, task publication, exit/wait state,
process-runtime capabilities, signal targeting and timer-delivery integration.
`Process` is a stable identity that can outlive runnable threads; its weak
`ProcessRuntime` reference is separate from the externally visible exited state.
`Thread` owns a strong runtime reference and its own objective/subjective
credential pointers. `ProcessRuntime` is crate-private; external users operate
through `Process`, `Thread` and the semantic facade modules.

Syscall ABI decoding belongs to `ksyscall`; image loading belongs to `kexec`;
trap-loop and cleanup orchestration belong to `posix-process`; MM/VMA state
belongs to `memspace`; fd/resources, filesystem context and namespaces belong
to `kfd`/`kresources`, `fs_context` and `kns`. `kidentity` owns `PidHandle`
allocation and namespace number projection; public PID/TID values here currently
use root/global numbers. Concrete controlling-terminal behavior belongs to TTY
implementations of `ControllingTerminal`.

`ProcessPublication` stores strong published process identities and weak task,
group and session values inside stable slots. Per-process thread/group slots
retain stable bindings with weak target references. Child relation slots are
intrusive list entries prepared before relation updates. The global `INIT_PROC`
retains init identity; orphan reparenting reserves an init relation slot.

## Public interface groups and users

- Boot/clone owners call `build_process_thread`, `Thread::prepare_process_fork`
  or `prepare_thread_clone`, construct `TaskInner::new_user` using the matching
  identity, then call `publish_user_task`. `PublishedUserTask::commit` runs
  parent-side writeback before activation; abort/drop rolls back publication.
- `Process` runtime capabilities return filesystem/namespace/mm/resource/signal
  references and expose timer/exec/teardown operations. `LiveAddressSpace` owns
  an active mm-user handle; its mapping closure supplies both the locked space
  and observer/invalidation handles required by mapping runtimes.
- `scheduler`, `resource_limits`, `capability` and job-control mutation queries
  resolve non-exited processes. Query/pidfd views may retain published zombies.
  `procfs` additionally requires a representative published task for listing.
- `process_signals` resolves process/group/thread targets and calls `ksignal`,
  interrupting a chosen task. `None` probes a target without queuing a signal.
  These helpers do not perform all syscall permission checks.
- `process_exit` and `wait_reap` are used by lifecycle/syscall owners to sequence
  last-thread cleanup, stable exit publication, child scanning and final identity
  removal. `PidFd` implements `Pollable` and anonymous-file operations against
  stable identity and exit completion.
- `migrate_cgroup_process` adapts a PID and filesystem authorization callback to
  process-wide migration; `scheduler` coordinates published task memberships.
  `CurrentThread` credential preparation/commit replaces only the calling
  thread's pointers; `ptrace` checks cross-task read credentials.
- `timer_delivery` registers `ktimer` expiry and `ksignal` dequeue observers;
  CPU timers run on current-user-thread return and wall timers on the alarm task.
  `UserTaskRuntime for Thread` supplies CPU residency and AArch64 switch roots to
  `ktask`; `CurrentSignalDispatch` adapts current-task signal injection.
- `TaskStat`, `system_view`, nice/scheduler and CPU-accounting APIs provide
  procfs/scheduler snapshots rather than owning hardware scheduling policy.

## Execution context and calling constraints

Construction, fork, runtime capability acquisition, publication, cgroup migration
and most facade operations allocate or acquire sleepable locks. They require
initialized allocator/scheduler and relevant MM/filesystem/namespace services;
they are not general interrupt-context or early-boot APIs. Current-user helpers
require a `Thread` installed in the current task. `current_fs_context` alone
falls back to `init_fs` for kernel tasks; it still requires initialized filesystem
state. A `CurrentThread` handle is created without validating its payload, but
its dereference requires a matching user runtime.

The process-domain spin rwlock is IRQ-safe and non-sleeping. Relation snapshots
use its read side; fork/exit/reparent/reap/publication mutations use its write
side. No sleepable lock, resource destructor or external signal callback may be
introduced under that transaction. Callbacks passed to cgroup authorization,
scheduler validation, TEE access or mapping access execute while the documented
owner lock is held and must avoid recursive acquisition/incompatible lock order.
Timer initialization is once-only and requires timer/signal/task runtime ready.
CPU accounting depends on monotonic time; task runtime hooks depend on MM CPU
residency and architecture initialization.

## State transitions

The actual `ProcessExitState` variants are Running, Zombie and Dead. New
identities start Running even before publication; “prepared” or “exiting” are
control-flow phases, not extra enum variants. Exit changes Running to Zombie
for waitable policy or Dead for autoreap, reparents children to init and resets
their exit signal to SIGCHLD. Init is excluded from this normal exit transition.
A consuming wait changes Zombie to Dead and removes parent membership;
`WaitReapMode::Peek` leaves it intact. A scan returns Ready, NoMatchingChild or
NoWaitableChild according to selector, exit-signal class and actual state.

Publication slots transition Vacant/Retired → Reserved → Published; retirement
clears the value to Retired before structural directory deletion. Reservation
of an already Published identity leaves it published. Cleanup removes only the
same slot when it is Vacant/Retired, protecting reused PID/TID bindings. A
`PublishedUserTask` owns a rollback record until activation consumes it.

Thread accounting uses None/User/Kernel: each state change charges elapsed time
to the prior state before selecting the next. Thread exit and no-new-privileges
are separately published atomic flags. Group/session changes create or select a
group and publish group/session identity together; existing-group movement
requires the same session. The syscall owner checks additional leader/ID rules.

## Critical flows

Fork takes the process cgroup gate, reserves a child charge, clones/shares fs and
namespaces, allocates a root identity and validates/attaches the child relation.
Shared fs while its parent is in exec returns WouldBlock; namespace errors map
to InvalidInput/Unsupported or a mount error. `CallerParent` inherits the
caller's current parent and exit-signal contract, rechecking it under the domain
lock. Runtime preparation then clones/shares mm, signal actions and fd table;
`AttachedForkProcess` rolls back the attached relation if preparation fails.
The new thread starts from the caller's subjective credential snapshot and
inherits no-new-privileges. A sibling clone shares the existing runtime.

Publication reconciles the thread's cgroup under the gate, reserves table/member
slots under the publication table write lock, then publishes all visible slots
under one domain write transaction. Parent writeback runs after visibility and
before activation. Failure/drop retires owned bindings and removes an inserted,
still-running unpublished child relation; it does not retire an unrelated
existing process identity. Retired slot deletion checks pointer identity and
state to tolerate numeric ID reuse.

Last-thread cleanup is orchestrated by `posix-process`: remove thread visibility,
record final CPU time, detach mm/files/fs/ns and optional resources, then call
`complete_process_exit`. SIGCHLD preparation occurs outside the domain lock;
parent/exit-signal changes cause retry. The domain transaction commits exit,
autoreap and reparent; only then are signal queueing and parent wakeup performed.
Default SIGCHLD, explicit ignore and no-child-wait policy come from `ksignal`.
Child-exit payloads contain wait status, PID/UID and CPU time. If no published
thread credential snapshot exists at payload construction, the current code
uses UID zero. Non-SIGCHLD exit signals use the generic process-send path.

Wait scans/matches/consumes under the domain write lock and returns a stable
`WaitedChild`. The wrapper adds child CPU totals and removes the retired directory
entry outside that lock. `finish_thread_exit` retires TID visibility before later
resource teardown, so external thread lookup stops targeting exit-tail tasks.

Exec updates optional TA context, heap, signal dispositions, POSIX timers,
close-on-exec files and optional IPC/private state, then publishes path/cmdline
under one `ExecMetadata` lock. A failure closing descriptors can occur after
earlier changes: the operation is not an all-state rollback transaction. The
combined metadata update is atomic, but separate path and cmdline calls need not
observe the same generation across a concurrent exec.

## Concurrency model

Lock order for publication is process cgroup gate → publication tables → process
domain → small spin-locked slots. Exit/reap retire visibility under the domain
lock, release it, then remove table entries. Lookup first collects table slot
references and then observes them under the domain read lock. Tree/member/group
locks protect local containers; cross-object invariants require the domain token.
Session terminal and group lists have their own IRQ-safe spin locks.

Runtime fs/ns slots and exec metadata use RwLock; mm-user state, CPU accounting,
scheduler state and timers use mutexes. Thread credential commit takes objective
then subjective credential write locks and asserts the pointers were not
independently overridden. CPU totals use relaxed nanosecond atomics and are
observational counters, not publication barriers. Heap and thread control fields
use their documented atomic orderings; no single atomic read proves an entire
process snapshot is current. `Process::resources` can retain the resource object
after its fd-table slot was detached, and `mm_id` remains available while the
runtime shell exists even after active mm ownership is released.

## Resource lifecycle, decisions and limitations

Threads strongly retain runtime, while Process retains it weakly to avoid an
identity/runtime cycle. `MmUserHandle` counts active users; `MmPin`/observers
retain metadata without keeping user mappings alive. Releasing the final active
user clears mappings; `LiveAddressSpace` delays that event while held. Exit takes
owner slots once and drops objects outside their locks; repeated detach is safe
while the runtime shell remains reachable. Zombies/pidfds retain stable identity
without requiring attached files, filesystem paths or namespaces.

Preallocated intrusive child slots keep commit-time relations within the
non-sleeping domain boundary; stable publication slots separate visibility from
allocating/deleting BTreeMap entries. Dedicated semantic query modules prevent
callers from reconstructing lifecycle policy from weak runtime references.
Known limits include root/global PID semantics, no child-subreaper implementation,
representative-thread credential snapshots, simplified ptrace privilege checks
(effective UID zero substitutes for CAP_SYS_PTRACE), and no full authorization
policy in signal/job-control facade helpers. Optional TEE/TIPC behavior exists
only with its Cargo feature enabled.
