# ksignal security and reliability

## Scope, assets, and boundaries

All of `src/` is covered. Assets are signal state consistency (blocked sets,
pending queues, actions), the integrity of the user handler frame, and the
`siginfo` payloads consumed by user handlers. Trusted callers are `ksyscall`
(ABI decoding and permission checks, e.g. kill permission and signo
validation) and the posix process runtime. Untrusted inputs reaching this
crate are: user-supplied `sigaction`/`siginfo`/`sigprocmask`/`sigaltstack`
payloads (validated ABI values converted before the call), user stack memory
holding signal frames, and the return address of the handler trampoline.

## External boundaries

| Boundary | Direction | Content |
|---|---|---|
| User memory (via `osvm` `write_vm`) | kernel writes | handler frame (`ucontext`, `siginfo`, restorer push) |
| User memory (direct deref) | kernel reads | `sigreturn` frame at user `sp` |
| User ABI payloads via `ksyscall` | inbound | sigaction structs, siginfo (rt_sigqueueinfo), sigset words, sigaltstack |
| Alternate signal stack | user-controlled addresses | `sp`/`size` used for frame placement |
| Signal trampoline page | kernel text mapped user-readable/exec | fixed `SIGNAL_TRAMPOLINE` vaddr |

## Unsafe inventory

All unsafe blocks are in `types.rs` plus one in `api/thread.rs`; each carries
an inline `SAFETY:` justification.

| Location | Operation | Invariant |
|---|---|---|
| `types.rs` `SignalInfo::empty` | `mem::zeroed()` for `siginfo_t` | all-zero is a valid baseline; constructors set header and exposed payload fields before observation |
| `types.rs` `header`/`header_mut`/`sifields`/`sifields_mut` | union arm access | bindgen preserves ABI offsets; readers only touch the arm selected by `si_code` or by the constructor that populated it |
| `types.rs` `ChildExitSignalInfo::new` | `_sigchld` arm write | `CLD_*` codes select the arm and every exposed field is initialized |
| `types.rs` `timer_id`/`timer_overrun`/`timer_signal_seq`/`sigval` | arm reads | guarded by `SI_TIMER` or negative `si_code` checks |
| `types.rs` `unsafe impl Send/Sync for SignalInfo` | auto-trait override | payload is opaque ABI bits, not dereferenceable aliases; mutation requires `&mut` |
| `api/thread.rs` `restore` | `&*(sp as *const SignalFrame)` | trusts that user `sp` maps the frame previously written by `dispatch_irq_signal` |

The union-arm reads are the `k_sigval`/`siginfo_t` ABI boundary: the kernel
treats payload fields as raw bits and never dereferences pointer-like values
(`sival_ptr`) stored by userspace.

## Threat analysis

| ID | Threat | Severity | Trigger | Response |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| T-01 | Handler frame overwrite of unmapped/guard user stack | Medium | `SA_ONSTACK` with invalid `sigaltstack`, or stack exhaustion at dispatch | Frame write uses checked `write_vm`; failure is converted to `CoreDump` fatal exit instead of a kernel fault |
| T-02 | `sigreturn` on a corrupted/forged frame | Medium | user changes `sp` or overwrites frame memory, then calls `rt_sigreturn` | Context restore treats frame contents as data; register/pc/sp are re-entered through the normal user-return path so a bad frame cannot corrupt kernel state. Privileged/restorable state comes from the kernel-written `saved` copy; `sigmask` is range-limited by `SignalSet`. Residual risk: user can forge its own register set, which is also true on Linux |
| T-03 | Invalid `si_signo` from user `siginfo` reaching decode | Medium | `rt_sigqueueinfo` payload with signo 0 or >64 | `ksyscall` validates the signo before conversion; `SignalInfo::signo` documents the panic contract for unvalidated payloads. Residual: the crate itself trusts its callers here |
| T-04 | Stale POSIX timer signal delivered after timer rearm | Low | timer signal dequeued after `timer_settime` changed the timer | dequeue observers compare the embedded `signal_seq`; stale signals are dropped (`kprocess` wiring) |
| T-05 | Signal flood exhausting kernel memory | Medium | unbounded `rt_sigqueueinfo`/timer expirations | Standard signals coalesce to one instance; real-time queues are bounded by sender rate — matches Linux behavior; no additional kernel cap (accepted residual risk, same as Linux) |
| T-06 | Observer table races | Low | re-registering an observer while signals dequeue | Table access is `SpinNoIrq`-serialized; overwrite is documented last-wins |
| T-07 | `SignalInfo` auto-trait unsoundness | High (if violated) | storing a `sival_ptr` that becomes a dereferenceable alias | `unsafe impl` is justified by opaque-bits treatment; all reads return raw values, no dereference of payload pointers exists in this crate |

## FMEA

| ID | Failure mode | Cause | Local effect | System effect | Sev | Response |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| F-01 | Frame write fails | unmapped user stack | dispatch returns `CoreDump` | process exits | 3 | documented fatal path |
| F-02 | Dead thread entry kept in `children` | thread exit without prune | stale tid selected | wake/interrupt to dead tid is filtered by callers; entries pruned on next scan | 4 | opportunistic `retain` pruning |
| F-03 | Pending bit set without queue entry | bookkeeping divergence under concurrent put/dequeue of same signal | dequeue returns `None` while bit set (fast-path flag stays true) | extra slow-path iterations, no lost signal | 4 | bit and queue mutated under the same `SpinNoIrq` per manager |
| F-04 | `has_pending` false negative | ordering bug between store and queue | signal delayed until next set | latency only | 4 | Release store after successful put; Acquire loads on check |

## Thread safety

Managers use per-field `SpinNoIrq` cells; `SignalActions` is `Arc`-shared
and locked per access. `SignalSet` is a plain `Copy` bitmap shared by value.
`SignalInfo` `Send`/`Sync` rely on the opaque-bits invariant above. The
global observer table is lock-serialized. `find_target_thread` mutates the
children list (prune) during sends from any thread.

## Failure handling

All user-memory writes in dispatch return an OS action (`CoreDump`) rather
than an error to keep the user-return path uniform. Queue operations are
infallible. `signo()` and the observer registration functions document their
panic contracts; no other intentional panics exist in this crate.

## Privacy analysis

`SignalInfo` carries child exit status, PIDs, UIDs and CPU times — process
metadata, not user file content. No other user data is processed or logged.

## Known limitations

- `SIGSTKFLT` default action follows Linux (terminate) though it is unused.
- `SignalOSAction::Stop`/`Continue` are reported, but job-control stop state
  is approximated by the posix runtime (documented there: stop currently
  exits with code 1).
- FPU/vector state is not carried in the ABI `fpregs` (x86_64 zeroes
  `fpregs_mem`); restoration goes through `UserRestorableContext` only.
- `restore` trusts a mapped frame at `sp`; a corrupted frame produces a user
  fault after return rather than a kernel-side checked error.

## Audit checklist

- New `si_code` producers must populate the union arm they advertise before
  the `SignalInfo` can be observed.
- Every new user-memory access in the dispatch path must use checked `osvm`
  access; never raw deref on the write side.
- Keep `SIGKILL`/`SIGSTOP` unblockable in `set_blocked`.
- Dequeue observers must stay cheap and non-sleeping.
- Fast-path atomics must be updated with the queue-lock discipline described
  in design.md (store after successful enqueue under lock).

## signalfd readiness observers

A successfully queued process or thread signal notifies the process arrival
PollSet only after all local signal-state spin guards have been released.
Callbacks may synchronously re-enter pending-state inspection; holding a queue
lock across wake would deadlock. No user pointers or new unsafe operations are
introduced. Pending masks and send_signal's target/interrupt result are unchanged.

The notification source is process-scoped and carries no signal payload. Readers
must use their current thread plus process queue and their own selected mask.
Spurious wakes do not authorize consumption of another thread's pending signals.
Tests cover both directed paths, callback re-entry, cancelled subscriptions,
shared descriptors and fd-mask updates. This does not broaden inherited epoll
registration guarantees across fork.
