# ksignal design

## Purpose

`ksignal` owns the Linux signal data model and the per-process/per-thread
signal state of X-Kernel: signal numbers and sets, `siginfo_t` payloads,
dispositions, pending queues, blocking state, alternate stacks, and the
construction/restoration of user handler frames. `kprocess` embeds its
managers into process/thread runtimes; `kexec` maps the signal trampoline
during exec; `ktimer` produces timer `siginfo` payloads and depends on
`ksignal` types; `ksyscall` and the posix process runtime own ABI decoding,
permission checks, and the teardown actions behind `SignalOSAction`.

`ProcessSignalManager` holds process-shared actions and a process-directed
pending queue; each `ThreadSignalManager` registers itself with the process
manager through a `Weak` reference at creation. Thread dequeue first drains
the thread queue, then falls back to the process queue. `SignalActions` is
shared by `Arc` so `sigaction` updates are immediately visible to every
thread.

## Queuing and delivery algorithm

`PendingSignals` keeps one `Option<Box<SignalInfo>>` per standard signal
(1-31; at most one pending instance) and one `VecDeque` per real-time signal
(32-64; queued instances, FIFO). The `SignalSet` bitmap drives dequeue order:
`dequeue_signal` picks the lowest-numbered unblocked pending signal, and a
non-empty real-time queue re-marks its bit so the next instance stays
selectable.

`send_signal` (process) mirrors Linux `prepare_signal`/`complete_signal`:
an ignored disposition drops the signal only when no live thread currently
blocks it — a blocked signal stays pending because userspace may install a
handler before unblocking. Target-thread selection picks the first live
non-blocking thread while pruning dead `Weak` entries. The thread-level
`send_signal` follows the same ignore/blocked policy.

`check_signals` uses two fast-path atomics (`possibly_has_signal`,
process `has_pending`) to avoid locks on the common no-signal return. The
slow path dequeues against `!blocked`, consults dequeue observers (used by
`kprocess` timer delivery to drop stale POSIX timer signals), then dispatches
through `dispatch_irq_signal`.

Handler dispatch builds a `SignalFrame { ucontext, siginfo, saved }` on the
user stack (alternate stack when `SA_ONSTACK` and configured), rewrites
`UserContext` to enter the handler with `(signo, siginfo*, ucontext*)`
arguments, sets the restorer return path (x86_64 pushes it on the stack,
others use the return register), applies the handler mask plus the signal
itself unless `SA_NODEFER`, and resets the action to default on
`SA_RESETHAND`. Syscall-restart error codes in the trap context are folded
into either a rollback (restart) or `-EINTR` before the handler runs;
`restart_syscall_without_signal` in the posix runtime covers the no-signal
return path. `restore` reads the frame back on `rt_sigreturn`, restores the
blocked set from `uc_sigmask`, and re-arms the pending flag.

Child-exit notification is split into `prepare_child_exit_signal` (decision)
and `commit_child_exit_signal` (queueing) so `kprocess` can publish exit and
autoreap state before `SIGCHLD` becomes observable; the default-ignored
disposition of `SIGCHLD` does not suppress queuing, while explicit `SIG_IGN`
and `SA_NOCLDWAIT` request autoreap.

## Execution context

- All managers are lock-based (`SpinNoIrq`) and involve no sleeping within
  this crate; they are safe on syscall and trap return paths.
- `dispatch_irq_signal`, `check_signals`, and `restore` run on the
  user-return path of the owning thread; `dispatch_irq_signal` writes to
  user memory through `osvm` checked access (`write_vm`), so it may fail on
  an unmapped stack, which is reported as `CoreDump`.
- Handler invocation itself never happens here: the caller observing
  `SignalOSAction::Terminate/CoreDump/Stop/Continue` performs teardown in
  the posix process runtime, which may sleep.
- Dequeue observers run synchronously inside the dequeue path; observers
  must only rely on properties guaranteed by every path that can dequeue
  their signal (in practice: current user thread with its process runtime
  reachable).
- `register_signal_observer` mutates a global table; registration is
  expected during subsystem init, not on hot dequeue paths.
- `map_signal_trampoline` requires a mutable `MmSpace` and runs during exec
  address-space setup.

## State

Pending-queue state is queue/bitmap bookkeeping without an explicit state
machine. The `SignalDisposition` of each action is `Default | Ignore |
Handler(fn)`, replaced wholesale by `sigaction` and reset to `Default` by
`SA_RESETHAND` during dispatch. `saved_sigmask` is an `Option<SignalSet>`
set by `rt_sigsuspend` and consumed by the next caught-signal frame build
(Linux `saved_sigmask` semantics).

## Concurrency

- `ProcessSignalManager.pending`, `.actions`, `.children` and each thread's
  `pending`/`blocked`/`saved_sigmask`/`stack` are independent `SpinNoIrq`
  cells; no cross-field lock ordering exists inside this crate.
- `send_signal` reads actions and scans children inside one actions-lock
  generation to keep the disposition decision and target scan coherent; the
  doc comments deliberately do not claim Linux's global `sighand->siglock`
  equivalence for every field.
- `has_pending`/`possibly_has_signal` are Release/Acquire hints only; the
  authoritative check happens under the queue locks.
- Dead thread entries are pruned opportunistically during target scans.
- `SignalInfo` is `Send + Sync` through an explicit `unsafe impl` because
  the payload is treated as opaque ABI bits (see `security.md`).

## Design decisions

- Handler functions are typed `unsafe extern "C" fn(i32)` and stored as an
  address; the kernel never calls them directly — it only writes a user
  frame — so no kernel-side indirect call risk is introduced.
- The signal frame embeds both the ABI `ucontext_t`/`siginfo_t` (user-visible
  layout, musl-compatible register numbering) and a private
  `UserRestorableContext` so `sigreturn` restores privileged/restorable
  state from a kernel-controlled copy even though the ABI part is
  user-writable.
- x86_64 pushes the restorer address on the user stack to match the
  kernel-only `SA_RESTORER` ABI; other architectures use the return-address
  register.
- A trampoline page is mapped at a fixed address per address space so
  binaries without a vdso still get a working `sigreturn`.
- Kernel-originated `sigval` reads expose `None` unless `si_code` implies a
  user or timer payload, keeping union-arm reads (see `security.md`)
  guarded by the code that selected the arm.

## Resource lifecycle

Managers are created by `kprocess` when a process/thread runtime is built
(`ThreadSignalManager::new` self-registers with the process manager). No
kernel resources are allocated beyond the queues themselves; frame memory
lives in user address space and alternate stacks are user-owned. There is
no explicit Drop behavior in this crate.

## Pending arrival notification

ProcessSignalManager owns a PollSet for arrivals to the process queue or any
member thread queue. Both enqueue paths publish the pending signal, release
pending/action/children locks, then wake this source. ThreadSignalManager exposes
registration for signalfd readers. The source is a recheck hint, not a claim
that a particular fd mask or calling thread has a matching signal. Unrelated
thread arrivals can wake subscribers; final readiness/dequeue still uses the
calling thread's private plus process pending state.

This follows the separation used by Linux signalfd: queue readiness notifications
are independent of whether ordinary handler delivery can interrupt a task.
Blocked signals stay blocked; no forced task interruption, periodic polling or
signalfd-to-creator-thread binding is added. The source owns no file/thread
callbacks directly: cancellable PollRegistrations retain the existing kpoll
lifecycle, including an allowed late wake after concurrent cancellation.
