# kplat-loongarch64 — Security And Reliability

## Scope

This analysis covers the entire crate: `src/lib.rs` (module wiring and
default platform contracts), `src/init.rs` (boot handoff), `src/time.rs`
(stable counter), `src/irq.rs` plus `src/irq/eiointc.rs` and
`src/irq/pch_pic.rs` (interrupt hierarchy), `src/mp.rs` (SMP boot), and
`src/power.rs` (power control). No modules are excluded. Firmware
descriptions are consumed through `of` and validated there; the raw
IOCSR/MMIO accesses audited below are this crate's own boundary.

## Trust Model

The device tree and the architectural registers are the two external
inputs. The DTB is structurally validated by `rs_fdtree`/`of`; the
values read from it (power-off register and byte, console node) are
trusted boot policy. Controller registers (EIOINTC IOCSR, PCH PIC MMIO)
are hardware state this crate owns exclusively after mapping. There is
no user-space input.

## External Boundaries

- **Device tree `syscon-poweroff` node**: yields the physical S5
  register address and the request byte. Checked properties: the node
  must carry a `regmap` phandle, `offset`, and `value`
  (`of::syscon_poweroff` returns `None` otherwise). Failure result: the
  terminal logs and halts instead of writing any register.
- **RTC MMIO aperture**: mapped from the build-time `RTC_PADDR` for
  `LS7A_RTC_SIZE` bytes; failure panics with the mapping error. The
  sampled value is validated by the `rtc_driver` LS7A backend (year
  consistency) before it reaches `ktime`.
- **Console device tree node**: parsed by `console_driver`; a parse
  failure panics in `early_driver_init` (a machine without a declared
  console cannot boot usefully).

## Unsafe Code

- `power.rs` `SleepControlRegister::write`: one volatile byte store to
  the GED sleep-control register mapped by `iomap_device` — the
  `SAFETY:` comment cites the exact one-byte mapping.
- `mp.rs`: CSR mailbox and IPI sends through `loongArch64` register
  helpers (safe wrappers over privileged instructions).
- `time.rs`: stable-counter reads through the `loongArch64` crate's
  safe register API.
- The EIOINTC/PCH PIC backends perform IOCSR/MMIO access through
  `loongArch64::iocsr` and `VirtAddr` pointers mapped at init; every
  public backend entry rejects out-of-range hwirq before any register
  access (`warn!` + return), so no access can compute an out-of-window
  offset.

## Protected Resources

- `PCH_PIC_BASE` (`LazyInit<VirtAddr>`): the 4 KiB PCH PIC aperture at
  the fixed platform address `0x1000_0000`; all PCH accesses are
  offset-checked against it.
- `NANOS_PER_TICK` (`LazyInit<u64>`): the counter-frequency conversion,
  computed once in `early_init`.
- The GED sleep-control mapping: one byte, mapped only in the
  `power_off` terminal path.

## Threat Analysis

| ID | Threat | Impact | Trigger | Existing control |
|----|--------|--------|---------|------------------|
| T-01 | Malformed `syscon-poweroff` node | Medium — power-off writes a wrong register | Corrupt or hostile DTB | `of::syscon_poweroff` requires a resolvable regmap phandle and offset/value properties; absence degrades to halt. Residual risk: a valid-but-lying declaration is indistinguishable from firmware truth. |
| T-02 | Out-of-range external hwirq | Medium — writes into an unrelated controller vector | Bad IRQ number from above | Range gate in `IntrManagerIf::enable` against `PCH_PIC_IRQ_COUNT` plus backend-level re-checks (`eiointc`/`pch_pic` reject before access). |
| T-03 | Invalid RTC sample (torn year) | Low — wall clock not initialized | LS7A TOY counters straddling new-year | `rtc_driver` LS7A backend re-samples until the year halves agree and rejects persistent instability; `early_driver_init` propagates the failure as a panic. |
| T-04 | Spurious external IRQ line | Low — wasted IRQ cycle | Noise on a PCH PIC input | EIOINTC claim returns `None`; the dispatcher logs `"Spurious external IRQ"` and returns without dispatching. |
| T-05 | `boot_ap` for an unmapped logical CPU | Medium — AP boots with a wrong context | CPU-id table missing an entry | Named panic in the `SysCtrl::boot_ap` provider before any mailbox write. |

## Failure Modes

| ID | Failure mode | Local effect | System effect | Severity | Handling |
|----|--------------|--------------|---------------|----------|----------|
| F-01 | RTC aperture mapping fails | Panic in `early_driver_init` | Boot fails | 2 | A machine whose RTC cannot be mapped cannot establish wall time. |
| F-02 | No `syscon-poweroff` declaration | Warn + halt on power-off | Power stays on; system halted | 3 | Documented degradation path. |
| F-03 | Console node parse failure | Panic in `early_driver_init` | Boot fails | 2 | A machine without a usable console aborts rather than running headless silently. |
| F-04 | `notify_cpu` / `set_prio` called | `todo!()` panic | Offending caller aborts | 2 | Unimplemented capability (see Known Limitations); surfaced loudly instead of misrouting. |

## Known Limitations

- `IntrManagerIf::notify_cpu` and `set_prio` are `todo!()`
  placeholders: interrupt steering and priority routing are not
  implemented for this platform.
- `suspend_to_ram` is unsupported (`KError::OperationNotSupported`);
  the GED register could express S3 but no wakeup path exists.
- Only the QEMU virt-class EIOINTC + PCH PIC hierarchy is supported;
  other LoongArch interrupt topologies are out of scope.

## Audit Checklist

- Backend hwirq range gates remain ahead of any IOCSR/MMIO access.
- The RTC mapping size and address still come from `RTC_PADDR` /
  `LS7A_RTC_SIZE`, and the sample still flows through
  `rtc_driver::read` before `ktime`.
- Power-off still reads its register and byte from the firmware
  declaration rather than machine constants.
- Any new `kiface` provider method either has a real implementation or
  a recorded limitation here, not a silent `todo!()`.
