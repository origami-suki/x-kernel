```

- `kdriver` trusts `device-res-xkernel` to implement the `device_res` provider contract
  correctly. Driver-facing devres APIs are exposed through
  `kdriver::resource::DeviceResourceExt`.
  `kdriver::resource` explicitly passes `XKernelResourceProvider` and converts
  `ResError` into `DriverError`.
- `device-res-xkernel` trusts `kirq::try_register_shared()` to validate interrupt
  descriptors, manage action fanout, and provide teardown synchronization.
  `device_res` reserves a threaded-IRQ provider contract; the X-Kernel provider based
  on `main` currently still returns `Unsupported`.
- `kdriver` and `device-res-xkernel` trust `memspace::iomap_device` to reject mappings
  of invalid physical address ranges.
- `device-res-xkernel` trusts `kdma::allocate_dma_memory` and
  `kdma::deallocate_dma_memory` to handle matching, valid `(cpu_addr, bus_addr)` pairs.
- `kdriver` trusts `virtio::probe_mmio_device` to perform the required volatile-read
  safety checks before accessing MMIO registers.
- `kdriver` trusts each driver crate (`block::ahci`, `block::sdmmc`, and `net::ixgbe`)
  to define the safety preconditions of its `new(vaddr)` entry point correctly.
- External callers in the `kruntime` boot path trust that `init_drivers` runs after
  the platform's `early_driver_init`.

## External Boundaries and Attack Surface

`kdriver` is a core kernel crate that processes hardware description data.
Its attack surface primarily consists of untrusted physical addresses, IRQ numbers,
and device identities supplied by firmware, together with runtime configuration
values in PCI BAR registers.

The module directly or indirectly interacts with these boundaries:

- **Firmware input:** DT compatible strings, ACPI HID/CID, MMIO physical addresses,
  IRQ line numbers, and firmware source types (`DeviceTree` / `ACPI`).
- **PCI configuration space:** Vendor:device IDs, class/subclass, BAR addresses and
  sizes, header types, bridge secondary/subordinate bus numbers, and legacy INTx routing.
- **VirtIO MMIO registers:** Discovery registers such as `MagicValue`, `Version`,
  `DeviceID`, and `VendorID`.
- **Driver probe paths:** MMIO regions mapped through `iomap_first_mmio` or
  `devm_iomap`, and DMA buffers allocated through `devm_alloc_coherent`.
- **Interrupt registration:** IRQ line numbers supplied by firmware or PCI INTx routing
  are converted into `kirq::IrqSpec` by `device-res-xkernel` and connected to `kirq`
  through shared hardirq actions.
- **Compile-time static configuration:** Fixed platform addresses such as
  `kbuild_config::AHCI_PADDR` and `kbuild_config::SDMMC_PADDR`.

This module does not directly dereference userspace pointers; device discovery runs
in kernel process context.
It does parse physical addresses from firmware tables and PCI configuration space,
so physical address validation and MMIO mapping safety are central concerns.

Threat analysis should cover:

- Whether invalid firmware addresses can make MMIO mappings overwrite critical kernel data.
- Whether zero addresses left after PCI BAR allocation can bypass checks and map page zero.
- Whether devres IRQ handlers and `kirq` shared-action tokens have matching lifetimes.
- Whether mismatched DMA allocation/free layouts can corrupt memory.
- Whether paired `share`/`unshare` operations in the VirtIO HAL withstand malicious device DMA.
- Whether devres release ordering during device removal can cause use-after-free.

## Unsafe Code Inventory

### 1. device-res-xkernel — DMA Allocation

Location: `drivers/adapters/xkernel/device-res/src/dma.rs`

```rust
let info = unsafe { kdma::allocate_dma_memory(layout) }.map_err(|_| ResError::NoMemory)?;
```

Invariants:

- `layout` is constructed through `Layout::from_size_align(spec.len, spec.align)`,
  which validates the allocation layout.
- The returned `DmaAllocation` is owned exclusively by devres and released through
  `free_coherent` when the `DeviceObject` is removed.
- `cpu_addr` and `bus_addr` describe the same physical memory.

Safety rationale:

- `alloc_coherent` validates the size/alignment through `Layout` before calling
  `allocate_dma_memory`.
- `DmaAllocation` has no public destruction path; release is routed through
  `free_coherent` in the devres callback.
- The safety contract of `kdma::allocate_dma_memory` requires a valid layout and
  exclusive caller ownership of the returned buffer.

Callers:

- Driver probe paths through `devm_alloc_coherent`.

### 2. device-res-xkernel — DMA Release

Location: `drivers/adapters/xkernel/device-res/src/dma.rs`

```rust
unsafe { kdma::deallocate_dma_memory(info, layout) };
```

Invariants:

- `info` and `layout` match the original `alloc_coherent` call.
- Each `DmaAllocation` is released once, through devres LIFO cleanup and exclusive ownership.
- Device DMA has stopped before release, as guaranteed by the driver's remove callback.

Safety rationale:

- `free_coherent` reconstructs the layout using the same `Layout::from_size_align`
  arguments as `alloc_coherent`.
- `DmaAllocation` does not implement `Clone`; devres holds the sole ownership.

Callers:

- The `free_coherent` method of the `device-res-xkernel` provider, triggered by
  `device_res::DmaAllocation` destruction or devres release.

### 3. VirtIoHalImpl — Unsafe Trait Implementation

Location: `src/driver_registry/virtio/glue.rs:139`

```rust
unsafe impl VirtIoHal for VirtIoHalImpl { ... }
```

Overall invariants:

- `dma_alloc` and `dma_dealloc` use matching `(paddr, vaddr, pages)` tuples.
- `mmio_phys_to_virt` is called only for physical addresses aligned to `PAGE_SIZE_4K`.
- `share` and `unshare` are paired with matching directions.
- `dma_alloc` zeroes newly allocated memory through `write_bytes(0)` so the device
  cannot read residual kernel data.

Individual operations:

#### 3a. `dma_alloc`

Location: `src/driver_registry/virtio/glue.rs:148,150`

- Constructs `Layout::from_size_align(pages * PAGE_SIZE_4K, PAGE_SIZE_4K)` before
  calling `allocate_dma_memory`.
- Zeroes the allocation through `write_bytes(0)`:
  `unsafe { core::ptr::write_bytes(dma_info.cpu_addr.as_ptr(), 0, size) }`.
- Returns `(0, NonNull::dangling())` on failure; the VirtIO transport detects and
  reports the error.

#### 3b. `dma_dealloc`

Location: `src/driver_registry/virtio/glue.rs:165,178`

- Uses the same `Layout` as allocation: `pages * PAGE_SIZE_4K` bytes aligned to `PAGE_SIZE_4K`.
- Reconstructs `DMAInfo` from `paddr` and `vaddr` before calling `deallocate_dma_memory`.

#### 3c. `mmio_phys_to_virt`

Location: `src/driver_registry/virtio/glue.rs:183`

```rust
unsafe fn mmio_phys_to_virt(paddr: PhysAddr, size: usize) -> NonNull<u8> {
    iomap_mmio(paddr as usize, size, "virtio-mmio-hal")
        .expect("failed to iomap virtio MMIO region")
}
```

- `iomap_mmio` calls `memspace::iomap_device` through the standard MMIO validation path.
- Mapping failure panics. This path runs only after the VirtIO transport has confirmed
  that the device exists, so failure indicates a platform configuration error.

#### 3d. `share`

Location: `src/driver_registry/virtio/glue.rs:190,195`

```rust
unsafe fn share(buffer: NonNull<[u8]>, direction: BufferDirection, ...) -> PhysAddr {
    unsafe { kdma::map_dma_buffer(buffer, dma_direction(direction)) }
        .expect(...)
        .bus_addr.as_u64() as PhysAddr
}
```

- `buffer` is a valid buffer supplied to the VirtIO transport by `dma_alloc` or an upper layer.
- `direction` is correctly translated into `kdma::DmaDirection`.

#### 3e. `unshare`

Location: `src/driver_registry/virtio/glue.rs:203,209`

```rust
unsafe fn unshare(paddr: PhysAddr, buffer: NonNull<[u8]>, direction: BufferDirection, ...) {
    unsafe { kdma::unmap_dma_buffer(DmaBusAddress::new(paddr), buffer, dma_direction(direction)) };
}
```

- `paddr` and `buffer` come from the same `share` operation.
- The `virtio` transport guarantees paired calls.

Callers:

- The `virtio` transport layer: `VirtIoNetDev`, `VirtIoBlkDev`, `VirtIoGpuDev`,
  `VirtIoInputDev`, `VirtIoSocketDev`, and `VirtIo9pDev`.

### 4. VirtIO MMIO Discovery During Platform Enumeration

Location: `src/bus/platform_backend.rs:193`

```rust
(unsafe { virtio::probe_mmio_device(regs.as_ptr(), mmio.size) })
```

Invariants:

- `regs` comes from `iomap_mmio(mmio.base, mmio.size, "virtio-mmio-discovery")`,
  which validates the mapping.
- `mmio.size` matches the size used to create the mapping.
- Discovery reads only registers defined as read-only by the VirtIO specification,
  such as `MagicValue`, `Version`, and `DeviceID`.

Safety rationale:

- Success from `iomap_mmio` means that the physical address lies in a valid MMIO window
  and the mapping has been established.
- The safety precondition of `virtio::probe_mmio_device` requires `regs` to point to
  a valid, accessible MMIO region large enough for a complete VirtIO MMIO register frame.

Callers:

- `PlatformBackend::enumerate_firmware` through `virtio_mmio_registration`.

### 5. VirtIO MMIO Discovery During Driver Activation

Location: `src/driver_registry/virtio/mod.rs:194`

```rust
unsafe { virtio::probe_mmio_device(regs.as_ptr(), size) }.ok_or(DriverError::BadState)?;
```

Invariants:

- `regs` comes from `iomap_mmio(base, size, "virtio-mmio-transport")`.
- This path runs only for `DeviceLocation::Mmio` after the transport type has matched.
- `size` comes from `DeviceLocation::Mmio.size` and matches the value recorded during
  platform enumeration.

Safety rationale:

- The same as item 4.

Callers:

- `activate_virtio_mmio`, through `activate_virtio_device` and the VirtIO driver's `probe_device`.

### 6. AHCI Driver Probe

Location: `src/driver_registry/block/ahci.rs:27,61`

```rust
// line 27: DMA ordering barrier (dbar 0 on LoongArch64, no-op elsewhere)
karch::dma_read_barrier();

// line 61: construct AHCI driver from raw MMIO vaddr
let ahci = match unsafe { block::ahci::AhciDriver::<AhciHalImpl>::new(vaddr) } { ... };
```

Invariants:

- `vaddr` comes from `iomap_first_mmio(device, "ahci")`, with its lifetime managed by devres.
- The pointer returned by `iomap_first_mmio` remains valid while `device` is alive.
- `karch::dma_read_barrier()` is a safe wrapper that executes `dbar 0` on LoongArch64
  for AHCI DMA coherency and is a no-op on cache-coherent architectures.

Safety rationale:

- The safety precondition of `AhciDriver::new` requires `vaddr` to point to a valid,
  exclusive AHCI HBA MMIO window.
- `iomap_first_mmio` establishes mapping validity through `devm_iomap` and
  `memspace::iomap_device`.

Callers:

- `AhciDriver::probe_device` (feature `ahci`).

### 7. SDMMC Driver Probe

Location: `src/driver_registry/block/sdmmc.rs:42`

```rust
let dev = unsafe { block::sdmmc::SdMmcDriver::new(vaddr) };
```

Invariants:

- `vaddr` comes from `iomap_first_mmio(device, "sdmmc")`.
- The safety precondition of `SdMmcDriver::new` requires `vaddr` to point to a valid
  SD/MMC controller register region.

Safety rationale:

- Follows the AHCI pattern: `iomap_first_mmio` establishes mapping validity and
  devres manages its lifetime.

Callers:

- `SdmmcDriver::probe_device` (feature `sdmmc`).

### 8. IxgbeHal — Unsafe Trait Implementation

Location: `src/driver_registry/net/ixgbe_hal.rs:14`

```rust
unsafe impl IxgbeHal for IxgbeHalImpl { ... }
```

Individual operations:

- `dma_alloc` (line 17): `Layout::from_size_align(size, 8)` followed by `allocate_dma_memory`.
- `dma_dealloc` (lines 23 and 29): Reconstructs `Layout`, then calls `deallocate_dma_memory`.
- `mmio_p2v` (line 33): Directly converts a physical address to a virtual address through
  `khal::mem::p2v`, assuming that the caller supplies a valid physical address.
- `mmio_v2p` (line 37): Performs the reverse conversion through `khal::mem::v2p`.

Invariants:

- DMA allocation/deallocation use matching `(paddr, vaddr, size)` tuples.
- `mmio_p2v` and `mmio_v2p` run only after the probe has confirmed physical address validity.

Safety rationale:

- The `ixgbe` feature is currently a placeholder and does not enable the downstream
  dependency, so the HAL implementation is not called.

Callers:

- The `ixgbe` driver crate (feature `ixgbe`, currently a placeholder).

### 9. PL011 Serial Driver Probe

Location: [`src/driver_registry/char/serial.rs:99`](../src/driver_registry/char/serial.rs#L99),
where the `SerialKind::Pl011` branch of `resolve_port` calls `SerialPort::new_mmio_pl011`.

Invariants:

- `vaddr` comes from `device.devm_iomap(mmio, "serial")`; `paddr` and `mmio.size`
  describe the same MMIO resource.
- The firmware resource must describe a real PL011 register window, aligned for
  32-bit accesses and covering all registers used during construction and I/O.
- The mapping must remain valid while the port is in use.
  Device removal must stop port accesses before releasing the devres mapping.
- New ports are initialized exclusively before `publish` exposes them.
  The stdout path reuses the existing instance through `take_early_port` without reinitialization.

Safety rationale:

- `devm_iomap` uses the `device-res-xkernel` MMIO provider and `memspace::iomap_device`
  to establish a valid mapping. Mapping errors propagate through `?` before the
  constructor is called.
- The device's devres owns the mapping and manages its lifetime, releasing it on
  probe failure or device removal. `SerialPort` does not own the mapping itself.
- `Pl011SerialDriver::probe_device` completes construction in `resolve_port` before
  exposing the port through `publish`, preserving exclusive initialization.

Callers:

- `Pl011SerialDriver::probe_device` (feature `serial-pl011`).

## Memory Safety Invariants

1. **MMIO virtual address lifetime:** The `NonNull<u8>` returned by `devm_iomap` is valid
   only while the `DeviceObject` is alive. Probe failure or device removal releases
   the mapping through `iounmap`.
2. **Exclusive DMA buffer ownership:** The `DmaAllocation` returned by
   `devm_alloc_coherent` is owned exclusively by devres and has no public clone/copy interface.
3. **Paired DMA allocation/free:** `alloc_coherent` and `free_coherent` reconstruct
   `Layout` from the same `DmaSpec`, preserving size and alignment.
4. **IRQ handler registration order:** A devres handler is wrapped as a `kirq` action,
   then atomically inserted into the descriptor's action list by `kirq`.
5. **IRQ handler release:** Shared hardirq actions are removed by token; regular
   threaded actions are released through their regular action.
   `kirq` masks the line and waits for in-flight hardirq snapshots and the IRQ thread to exit.
6. **No heap allocation during IRQ dispatch:** `kirq` performs action fanout through
   a fixed-size stack snapshot.
7. **VirtIO DMA zeroing:** `dma_alloc` clears new allocations through `write_bytes(0)`
   to prevent devices from reading residual kernel data.
8. **Paired VirtIO share/unshare:** `share` and `unshare` are paired with matching
   directions by the `virtio` transport.
9. **Rejection of zero PCI BAR addresses:** BARs that remain zero after allocation
   are skipped during enumeration and are not registered as valid resources.
10. **Firmware physical address validation:** MMIO addresses supplied by firmware
    pass through `memspace::iomap_device` validation before mapping.
11. **Device identity allowlist:** VirtIO PCI device IDs are translated through the
    `pci_device_id_to_virtio_type` allowlist. Unknown IDs are registered as generic
    PCI devices without binding a VirtIO driver.

## Thread Safety

| Type | Send Conditions | Sync Conditions |
|------|-----------------|-----------------|
| `DeviceManager` | Fields satisfy `Send` | `SpinNoPreempt<BusManager>` provides interior mutability. |
| `BusManager` | `Vec<(BusId, Box<dyn BusBackend>)>` satisfies `Send` | Shared access is protected by `SpinNoPreempt`. |
| `EnumerationContext` | `Vec<DeviceDesc>` satisfies `Send` | Does not implement `Sync`; used by one thread. |
| `DriverRegistrar` | Zero-sized type | Accesses shared state only through the global `kdevice` lock. |
| `device-res-xkernel::XKernelResourceProvider` | Zero-sized type | The provider has no internally mutable state; `kirq` protects IRQ action state. |
| `PCI_BAR_ALLOCATOR` | `SpinNoPreempt<Option<PciRangeAllocator>>` satisfies `Send` and `Sync` | `SpinNoPreempt` provides interior mutability. |
| `PlatformBackend` | The `LocalIdAlloc` field is `Copy` and satisfies `Send` | Does not implement `Sync`; access is serialized by the `BusManager` lock. |
| `PciBackend` | `Cam` satisfies `Send` | Does not implement `Sync`. |
| `VirtIoHalImpl` | Zero-sized type | Calls `kdma` and `iomap_mmio`, each responsible for its own thread safety. |

## Threat Analysis

| ID | Threat | Impact Level | Trigger | Mitigation |
|----|--------|--------------|---------|------------|
| T-01 | Invalid firmware physical addresses cause MMIO mappings to overwrite critical kernel data | High | DT/ACPI describes malicious addresses that `memspace::iomap_device` does not reject | `iomap_device` checks platform MMIO window membership and returns `InvalidRange` for invalid ranges. |
| T-02 | A PCI BAR remains zero after allocation, causing a page-zero mapping | High | The BAR allocator is exhausted or its range is uninitialized, and configuration fails to reject zero addresses | `configure_pci_device_if_needed` returns `NoMemory` on allocation failure; enumeration pass 3 skips BARs with `address == 0`. |
| T-03 | IRQ registration races with interrupt arrival, invoking an unready handler | High | The interrupt reaches the virtual IRQ before its action is installed | `kirq` installs the action in its IRQ descriptor before enabling the line according to policy; the threaded default-primary entry enforces generic `ONESHOT`. |
| T-04 | DMA double-free corrupts memory | High | `free_coherent` is called more than once or the layout does not match | `DmaAllocation` does not implement `Clone`; devres has exclusive ownership, and allocation/free reconstruct `Layout` from the same `DmaSpec`. |
| T-05 | A VirtIO device accesses unauthorized kernel memory through malicious DMA descriptors | High | A malicious or faulty VirtIO device constructs an invalid descriptor chain | Individual VirtIO devices currently lack IOMMU isolation; `dma_alloc` zeroing prevents information disclosure, and `kdma` manages `share`/`unshare`. |
| T-06 | Firmware spoofs a device compatible string and binds the wrong driver | Medium | A false DT compatible string matches a registered `FirmwareMatchSpec` | An unresponsive device fails probe and enters the unclaimed list. |
| T-07 | A PCI device spoofs its vendor:device ID and matches the wrong VirtIO type | Medium | A malicious PCI device advertises the Red Hat vendor ID and a known VirtIO device ID | `probe_pci_device` validates the transport response again during activation and returns `Unsupported` on mismatch. |
| T-08 | Too many handlers on a shared IRQ cause unbounded traversal | Medium | More than 4 handlers register on one IRQ | `request_irq` returns `ResError::Busy`; dispatch uses a fixed-size stack snapshot. |
| T-09 | A PCI BAR allocator race assigns the same MMIO address to two devices | Medium | Concurrent BAR allocation is not serialized correctly | `PCI_BAR_ALLOCATOR` is protected by `SpinNoPreempt`, and allocation occurs under the lock. |
| T-10 | The serial driver remaps the stdout UART's MMIO and creates duplicate ownership | Medium | The serial driver calls `devm_iomap` again for the stdout node | Serial probe uses `take_early_port` and `SerialIdent` to adopt the early stdout instance without a second mapping. |
| T-11 | Incorrect devres release ordering frees resources while a device still uses them | Medium | The driver's remove callback returns without stopping device DMA | Devres LIFO cleanup preserves release ordering; the driver's remove callback is responsible for stopping the device. |
| T-12 | VirtIO MMIO discovery reads unmapped or invalid registers | Medium | Firmware advertises `virtio,mmio` but no VirtIO device exists at the physical address | `probe_mmio_device` first checks `MagicValue` and returns `None` if the VirtIO protocol is not present. |
| T-13 | An unchecked firmware IRQ number is registered on the wrong vector | Medium | `kirq::register` does not validate the IRQ number sufficiently | Depends on the platform IRQ backend and `kirq` descriptor handling; IRQ numbers passed by `kdriver` come from firmware or PCI INTx routing. |
| T-14 | Static platform device addresses such as AHCI_PADDR are misconfigured at compile time | Low | `kbuild_config` constants specify invalid physical addresses | `iomap_first_mmio` validates through `devm_iomap` and `iomap_device`; mapping failure prevents driver activation. |
| T-15 | Incorrect conversion between devres and kernel IRQ types causes bad IRQ configuration, lost source bitmaps, or unwoken IRQ threads | Medium | The `device-res-xkernel` adapter omits trigger/controller/event/wake-thread fields | `device-res-xkernel` centralizes `device_res` to `kirq` conversion; the IRQ core does not depend on devres. |

Impact levels:

- High: Undefined behavior, memory corruption, or privilege escalation.
- Medium: Panic, service unavailability, or inconsistent state.
- Low: Performance degradation, lost logs, or reduced functionality.

## Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA)

| ID | Failure Mode | Cause | Local Effect | System Effect | Severity | Mitigation |
|----|--------------|-------|--------------|---------------|----------|------------|
| F-01 | PCI bus enumeration fails | ECAM/MmioCam mapping failure or inaccessible configuration space | All PCI devices unavailable | PCI-dependent functions such as virtio-blk/net/gpu are unavailable | 2 | Log an error and return when `PciBus::new` fails, without blocking platform bus enumeration. |
| F-02 | Firmware provides no device description | Missing DT/ACPI tables or `has_device_description()` returns `false` | No devices registered through firmware enumeration | Only static devices remain, such as ramdisk and compile-time AHCI/sdmmc | 3 | Static device discovery is independent of firmware; log at info level. |
| F-03 | One device fails probe | The driver's `probe_device` returns an error | That device unavailable | Other devices on the same bus activate normally | 4 | Log the probe error at warn level and place the device in the unclaimed list; continue with subsequent devices. |
| F-04 | PCI BAR allocator uninitialized | `pci_bar_allocation_range()` returns `None` and a device has unassigned memory BARs | The PCI device is skipped | One PCI device unavailable | 3 | `configure_pci_device_if_needed` returns `NoMemory`, and the device is skipped. |
| F-05 | VirtIO MMIO discovery returns no device | No VirtIO device in the region or a `MagicValue` mismatch | The MMIO region is skipped | Other platform devices unaffected | 4 | `probe_mmio_device` and then `virtio_mmio_registration` return `None`; log at trace level and skip the region. |
| F-06 | IRQ handler registration fails | `kirq` rejects a shared action or its action limit is reached | The device cannot receive interrupts | Device unavailable or degraded to polling | 3 | `request_irq` returns `Busy`; driver probe returns an error. |
| F-07 | PCI host bridge adoption fails | Platform bus unregistered or `adopt_active_device` fails | PCI devices have no host bridge parent | PCI endpoints are still enumerated, but the device tree is incomplete | 3 | Log a warning and continue enumeration with a parentless layout. |
| F-08 | Static device MMIO mapping fails | Invalid `kbuild_config` address or absent hardware | The static device unavailable | Other devices on the same bus unaffected | 3 | `iomap_first_mmio` returns an error, and probe fails. |
| F-09 | Bus-type matcher is not ready when a driver registers | `register_bus_type` runs after driver registration | No device matches the driver | Devices enter the unclaimed list | 2 | `default_bus_manager` registers bus-type matchers before bus backends; drivers are then registered in `DeviceManager::new`. |
| F-10 | Rescan produces duplicate device descriptors | The backend uses the default `rescan` hook and reruns full `enumerate` | `kdevice` may reject duplicates or create redundant descriptors | Incomplete hot-plug support | 3 | Default `rescan` reruns `enumerate`; backends may override it with incremental scanning. |
| F-11 | VirtIO transport type differs from the driver's declaration | Reported `DeviceKind` differs from the matched driver's `device_type` | Driver probe returns `Unsupported` | The device enters the unclaimed list | 4 | `activate_virtio_device` validates the type again in PCI/MMIO activation paths. |
| F-12 | Quiesce fails to stop device interrupts | Incorrect bus backend `quiesce` implementation or delayed hardware response | Interrupts continue arriving during shutdown | IRQ handlers may access released resources | 2 | Devres resources are released during remove, not quiesce; quiesce only masks interrupt sources. |

Severity levels:

- 1: Fatal; system crash or data loss.
- 2: Serious; functionality unavailable and restart required for recovery.
- 3: Moderate; degraded functionality with automatic recovery possible.
- 4: Minor; limited impact that users can tolerate.

## Failure Management

- Device probe failures return `DriverError` (`InvalidInput`, `Io`, `NoMemory`,
  `ResourceBusy`, `Unsupported`, or `BadState`) without panicking.
- PCI bus initialization failure logs through `error!` and returns `Ok(())`, allowing
  platform bus enumeration to continue.
- Individual firmware device registration errors are collected through
  `first_error.get_or_insert`; enumeration returns the first error after completing.
- MMIO mapping failures are converted through `memspace::IoMapError`, `ResError`,
  and `DriverError`, with traceability at each layer.
- IRQ registration failures return `ResError::Busy`, `ResError::NoMemory`,
  `ResError::Unsupported`, or `ResError::InvalidResource`; the upper probe layer
  returns the corresponding error.
- Unmatched devices enter the `unclaimed` list. `info!` logs their identity,
  location, and origin to help diagnose missing drivers.
- Except for the `expect` in `VirtIoHalImpl::mmio_phys_to_virt`, which runs only after
  the VirtIO transport has confirmed device presence, unsafe failure paths return
  `Result` or log errors.
- Panic paths primarily come from `expect` after `LazyInit::call_once`, where static
  initialization failure indicates a platform configuration error, and overflow in
  `LocalIdAlloc::alloc`, where `u16` overflow indicates an abnormal device count.

## Privacy Analysis

`kdriver` processes firmware device identity information: compatible strings,
ACPI HID/CID, PCI vendor:device IDs, and class/subclass values.
It also handles hardware resource descriptions such as physical addresses and IRQ numbers.
Debug/info logs include device names, BDF addresses, physical address ranges, and IRQ
line numbers, without user process data.

The module does not persist data.
Device topology is stored in the shared `kdevice` core and its lifetime is managed
by the global device registry.

Trace logs expose compatible strings encountered during firmware enumeration and
register values read during VirtIO MMIO discovery.
Production deployments should control exposure through log levels.

## Known Limitations

- PCI supports only segment 0. Multiple segments require extending the `PciBackend`
  domain parameter.
- The PCI BAR allocator uses simple sequential allocation through `PciRangeAllocator`,
  without BAR relocation or defragmentation.
- A shared IRQ supports at most 4 handlers; exceeding the limit prevents device activation.
- The `ixgbe` feature is a placeholder. Its HAL implementation is not called and has
  not been validated at runtime.
- Without a firmware description, `fxmac` only logs a warning and skips the device;
  its MMIO base cannot be obtained from compile-time configuration.
- Firmware enumeration does not process ACPI _DSD or complex device properties;
  it reads only compatible/HID/CID, MMIO, and IRQ resources.
- PCI hot-plug is supported only through full re-enumeration with `rescan`.
  There is no native hot-plug event handling or PCIe AER / hot-plug controller driver.

## Audit Checklist

When modifying this module, verify:

- Every `unsafe` block has a `SAFETY:` comment.
- New MMIO mapping paths use `devm_iomap` or `iomap_mmio`, which validate physical
  address ranges internally.
- New DMA allocation paths use `devm_alloc_coherent` or `kdma::allocate_dma_memory`,
  with matching layouts at `free` time.
- New IRQ registration passes through the `device-res-xkernel` devres provider into
  the `kirq` action list, instead of maintaining separate line-local fanout in `kdriver`.
- New IRQ release uses `device-res-xkernel` to call the matching `kirq` release API
  by token; `kirq` performs masking, synchronization, and cleanup after the final action leaves.
- When a new bus backend implements `BusBackend`, an individual device error in
  `enumerate` does not block enumeration of other devices.
- New PCI device-ID to VirtIO-type mappings are added in `pci_device_id_to_virtio_type`.
- New firmware compatible matching rules are declared in `firmware_specs.rs` and
  register the corresponding platform driver.
- New `DeviceDriver::probe_device` implementations return `DriverError` on failure
  rather than panicking.
- New `VirtIoHal` methods preserve `share`/`unshare` and `dma_alloc`/`dma_dealloc` pairing.
