# kdriver — Design

## Purpose

`kdriver` is x-kernel's device-driver orchestration and host-integration
crate. It owns bus-backend management, driver registration and matching,
the full discover → bind → activate pipeline, and devres-lifecycle-based
resource management (mmio / irq / dma / time). All activated runtime
devices are ultimately published into the matching typed `kclass`
registries.

`kdriver` is allowed to touch X-Kernel host APIs, but only as a provider
implementation holder, bus discovery backend, or concrete driver glue.
Reusable concrete drivers must still depend only on driver subsystem
contracts.

The intended audience is developers adding new bus backends, new device
drivers, or changing device discovery/matching policy.

## Background

The core of the Linux device model separates bus, device, and driver: the
bus discovers devices, drivers declare the device characteristics they
support, and the kernel performs matching and binding in between.
`kdriver` lands that architecture as crate-level abstractions:

- bus backends are abstracted behind the `BusBackend` trait, with PCI and
  platform instances;
- device descriptors (`DeviceDesc`) are produced by bus discovery and do
  not directly create runtime objects;
- drivers declare matchers and probe callbacks through the `DeviceDriver`
  trait;
- `kdevice` provides the shared device core, owning the persistent
  topology of `BusInstance`, `DeviceObject`, and `DriverObject`;
- `kclass` provides the typed publication entry per category
  (net / block / display / input / vsock / char / 9p).

## Architecture

When `block` is enabled, `block_completion::prepare_block_wait` implements
the block waiting contract, injected as a `PrepareBlockWait` function
pointer. `HostSignals` owns two private `kpoll::Completion`s: admission
uses consumable tokens, terminal uses a permanent `complete_all` and is
never re-initialized. `HostBlockWaiter` verifies task context through
`PreparedTaskWait` before creating sources and registering the terminal.
A separate terminal-registration guard is held across the admission wait
and spurious wakeups; on Drop it first revokes the registration, then
releases the signals and task references. The prepare function directly
returns the boxed waiter; `waiter.signals()` clones its existing
notification-state `Arc`; the terminal holds a single
`PollRegistration` rather than a multi-registration container, and
admission also holds a single local guard per round.

Admission parks after each check/register/recheck round; terminal only
try_waits or parks. Both wait sources share one prepared waker, so an
admission registration round cannot clear the terminal registration.
Admission releases that round's guard after each return/park; a
notification arriving before the next round's registration is retained as
a token. This provider is injected into the virtio-blk IRQ probe.
ktask/kpoll dependencies are enabled only by the block feature and are not
propagated to concrete drivers; existing filesystems keep using the same
generic block interface.

Each `prepare_block_wait` allocates five metadata heap objects: the boxed
waiter, the HostSignals `Arc`, two PollSet inner `Arc`s, and a KWaker
`Arc`. One private registration fits kpoll's inline storage with no extra
growth; no data buffers or data copies are added. The existing EEVDF wake
path may allocate, so this layer adding no wake bookkeeping allocations
must not be described as the whole wakeup chain being allocation-free.

## Block Device Completion Processing

`block_completion_dispatch` owns one `Arc<BlockIoReclaimer>` per device.
Probe creates it; IRQ calls its `mark_pending()`; task-context shutdown calls
its `stop_and_wait(&self, waiter)`. `BlockCompletionOperations` is implemented by the actual device and defines
how to reclaim completed requests, not host scheduling or request submission.

The reclaimer holds an intrusive pending_link, Weak device, ProcessingState
(phase, is_accepting, stop_notification), and a task-only stop mutex. One global
PENDING_DEVICES SpinNoIrq protects the per-CPU lists and all processing state.
Idle/Queued(cpu)/Running(cpu)/RunningAgain(cpu) are the processing phases. Detachment gives
the pinned CPU a finite batch; detached nodes remain Queued and cannot relink.
Callbacks and notifications run outside the global lock. RunningAgain requeues
only into the next batch. Enqueue and raise stay pinned across daemon wake.

Concurrent stop callers serialize on stop_lock through the terminal wait:
the single stop_notification cannot be overwritten. IRQ and softirq never take
this mutex, so it adds no lock acquisition to the I/O hot path. Stop takes a
fresh task-bound waiter prepared before teardown; no new terminal registration
can fail after disabling processing. A later closer finds Idle and returns.
The lock order is stop_lock -> PENDING_DEVICES, never the reverse.

Arc Drop does not stop processing. Activation must explicitly finish admitted
I/O, suppress device IRQ generation, release/synchronize its Irq, then call
stop_and_wait before destroying the transport. The owning CPU consumes disabled
queued entries without invoking the device. Stop waits for a running callback's
temporary device Arc to retire. Do not call stop from the device callback.
CPU unplug and forced callback cancellation remain out of scope.

Each device allocates one reclaimer Arc with an embedded stop mutex;
there is no per-mark allocation or data copy. Existing host scheduler wake costs
are unchanged. Request-local waiting remains separately owned in block_completion.

## Shared Block IRQ Lifecycle

### DMA And Execution Context

Ordinary block completion follows `complete_* -> pop_used -> Hal::unshare ->
device_res::unmap_streaming -> kdma::unmap_dma_buffer`. The existing provider
removes its mapping, copies reads back and returns bounce storage to the TLSF
pool. Pool creation is on map, not unmap; pool recycling and indirect descriptor
deallocation do not sleep in the audited implementation. Coherent virtqueue
destruction may perform different work and remains in task-context close.

This permits the Block softirq backend with the current provider. A provider
that needs sleepable reclamation must supply a task-context backend satisfying
the same block contracts. Neither hardirq nor softirq is sleepable.

No new block data copy is introduced, but the existing DMA bounce copies remain.
Reclaim cost depends on bytes as well as request count; finite batches and the
softirq outer-loop reschedule check do not bound a single pass in microseconds.
The existing scheduler's EEVDF enqueue can allocate, so allocation-free block
bookkeeping is not a claim of allocation-free end-to-end wakeup.

### Registration And Removal

`request_block_irq` returns the existing `device_res::Irq` directly. Its closure
holds a Weak device IRQ handler and the device's reclaimer Arc. It acknowledges
only that device, marks pending only for a claimed event, and preserves the
complete IrqEvent. An expired device returns NOT_HANDLED.

Each disk requests its own shared action through XKernelResourceProvider.
kirq owns fanout, capacity, compatibility checks and callback synchronization.
Provider errors propagate: no block bucket, capacity workaround, local callback
gate, extra registration owner, retry or polling fallback. In particular the
current four-action capacity can make setup fail; changing it belongs to kirq.

Dropping Irq in sleepable task context releases that action token. The existing
provider delegates to kirq, which waits for in-flight dispatches; currently this
is line-wide synchronization and can wait for a neighboring callback too.
The block adapter never masks the shared line. Activation must retain a strong
device reference through IRQ release and reclaimer stop. Callback snapshots
never own the activation object or its synchronous destructor.

IRQ adapter tests exercise per-device provider calls, token release, neighbor retention,
claimed/unclaimed dispatch, exact event propagation, expired targets and provider
failure. The mock has synchronous dispatch only; it does not prove concurrent
kernel release. That synchronization is covered by kirq's own regression tests.
driver_registry/virtio/block.rs owns DeviceId activation, rollback, publish-last
and hardware removal on top of the virtio request lifetime.
tests/block_requests.rs injects the real wait provider into that fake, blocks 24
callers across two CPUs, then acknowledges simulated IRQs and drives this
reclaimer through Block softirq. It does not publish a production IRQ disk.
Production PCI/MMIO block activation uses try_new_irq and the real host provider.
Missing/failed IRQ leaves no published disk. One BlockActivation owns the strong
device, optional native Irq, reclaimer and optional Gendisk throughout setup and
close. A task-only map stores an owned FnOnce close action to erase heterogeneous
transport types; IRQ and request paths never consult that map. A local activation's Drop also handles
partial setup failure. Registry and devres cleanup ownership precede publication.

VirtioDriver::remove takes the unique close action before bus teardown; device
core's begin_removing serializes remove, and its later devres cleanup repeats
the now-idempotent lookup. Close prepares fresh task-bound drain/stop waiters,
marks the device Closing, removes owned block lookup, waits for admitted calls,
suppresses device interrupts, drops native Irq, stops the reclaimer, then
destroys the transport. No registry/class spinlock spans a wait. Retained disks
can query cached geometry but new I/O returns Io. Physical tests are grouped in
src/tests/virtio_block_activation.rs and included beneath their owning module.

Block host tests are physically grouped in src/tests/. Each unit test file is
included under its owning module with #[path], preserving private access and
the existing test namespace without a test-only directory per runtime module.

## Initialization Paths

Initialization is split into three deliberately separate paths:

### 1. Platform early init (`early_driver_init`)

Runs before the generic driver model and brings up the subsystems that must
work earliest: timer, IRQ, and the boot console. This stage does not go
through bus enumeration — the platform HAL starts it directly.

### 2. The descriptor-first path

This is the main path, driven by `init_drivers()` → `discover_unified()`:

1. **Bus enumeration**: `PlatformBackend` and `PciBackend` each enumerate
   devices, writing `DeviceDesc`s into the `kdevice` shared core through
   `EnumerationContext::register_device`.
2. **Driver matching**: `EnumerationContext::probe_pending()` runs
   `kdevice::probe_device_desc` for every descriptor, matching against
   registered `DeviceDriver`s by `bus_type` + `matcher`.
3. **Binding and activation**: on a match, `DeviceDriver::probe_device` is
   called; the driver performs hardware initialization and publishes the
   runtime device into the `kclass` registries.
4. **Unmatched devices**: descriptors with no matching driver land in the
   `unclaimed` list — logged, but never blocking boot.

### 3. The adoption path

Reserved for devices that already run from early init but lack runtime
device-model objects (such as the boot console).
`kdevice::adopt_active_device` registers the running device into the device
tree so later sysfs/device query paths can discover it.

## State Machine

### Device core states

Each `DeviceRecord` in `kdevice` moves through:

## Flows

### PCI bus enumeration

1. Pick ECAM or MmioCam access per `pci_cam_kind()`.
2. Open `PciBus` and obtain configuration-space access.
3. Adopt the host bridge: create a `pci-host` device on the platform bus as
   the root of the PCI device tree.
4. **Pass 1**: walk all BDFs on bus 0..bus_end, dispatching on `HeaderType`:
   - `Standard` → endpoint list;
   - `PciPciBridge` → bridge list, reading secondary/subordinate bus
     numbers;
   - others → skipped with a log entry.
5. **Pass 2**: call `adopt_active_device` per PCI-to-PCI bridge to create
   the `pci-bridge` device object, plus the corresponding secondary
   `BusInstance`.
6. **Pass 3**: walk the endpoint list; for each device:
   - call `configure_pci_device_if_needed` to assign unassigned BARs and
     enable the command register;
   - read BAR info and build the `ResourceSet` (MMIO / IO port / legacy
     INTx IRQ);
   - detect VirtIO-over-PCI devices and attach `TransportInfo::Virtio`;
   - register through `EnumerationContext::register_device_with_parent`,
     with the parent pointing at the host bridge or parent bridge.

### Platform bus enumeration

1. **Firmware stage**: walk firmware-described device nodes (DT compatible
   / ACPI).
   - For each node, query the registered `FirmwareMatchSpec`s (AHCI,
     sdmmc, fxmac, ...) for compatible matching.
   - VirtIO MMIO is special-cased: the `virtio,mmio` compatible is
     detected and the MMIO region mapped to probe the VirtIO device type.
   - Build the `ResourceSet` (MMIO + IRQ) and register through the
     `EnumerationContext`.
2. **UART/serial nodes**: UART nodes in the DT (including the stdout
   console) are enumerated here. The stdout UART is reused by the serial
   driver through `take_early_port` (same hardware, no re-map); other
   UARTs map their own ports and publish as independent char devices.
3. **Static device stage**: register compile-time-known platform devices
   (ramdisk is always registered; AHCI/sdmmc/bcm2835-sdhci only when no
   firmware description exists).

   > The ramdisk storage backend is controlled by `KFEAT_DRIVER_RAMDISK_STATIC`:
   > when off it is 16 MiB of zeroed heap memory (driver validation only); when
   > on it is zero-copy backed by a filesystem image embedded at build time (path
   > from the Makefile variable `RAMDISK_IMG`, format from `RAMDISK_IMG_FS`,
   > default ext4, an empty image generated by `make ramdisk_img`), so it can be
   > mounted as a real read-write root filesystem. See
   > `drivers/contracts/block/src/ramdisk_image.rs`.

### Driver matching and activation

1. `EnumerationContext::probe_pending` takes all pending descriptors.
2. For each descriptor it calls `kdevice::probe_device_desc`:
   - filter drivers by `bus_type`;
   - call `DeviceDriver::matcher().matches(identity)` to test the match;
   - on a match, run bind → activate.
3. Successfully activated devices have their runtime objects published to
   the matching `kclass` registries.
4. Unmatched (`Unclaimed`) or requeue-requested (`Requeue`) descriptors
   enter the `unclaimed` list.

### VirtIO device activation

VirtIO drivers share one activation entry across the PCI and MMIO
transports:

1. **PCI path**: extract the BDF from `DeviceLocation::Pci`, reopen
   `PciBus`, and run `probe_pci_device`, confirming the transport's
   reported `DeviceKind` matches the driver's declaration.
2. **MMIO path**: extract the physical address and size from
   `DeviceLocation::Mmio`, `iomap_mmio`, then run `probe_mmio_device`.
3. **Dispatch**: `dispatch_virtio_try_new` dispatches on `DeviceKind`:
   - `DeviceKind::Net` → `VirtIoNet::try_new` → `kclass::publish_net`
   - `DeviceKind::Block` → `block::activate` → IRQ setup → `kclass::publish_block`
   - `DeviceKind::Display` → `VirtIoGpu::try_new` → `kclass::publish_display`
   - `DeviceKind::Input` → `VirtIoInput::try_new` → `kclass::publish_input`
   - `DeviceKind::Vsock` → `VirtIoSocket::try_new` → `kclass::publish_vsock`
   - `DeviceKind::Fs9p` → `VirtIo9p::try_new` → `kclass::publish_virtio_9p`

### Resource management (devres)

`device-res-xkernel` provides x-kernel's implementation type for the
`device-res` provider contract; the driver-facing resource API is exposed
to drivers by `kdriver::resource` as `DeviceResourceExt`.
`kdriver::resource` holds the static `XKernelResourceProvider` and passes
it explicitly to `device_res::devm_*_with_provider()`; on release the RAII
handles return to the same provider that created them:

- **`device.devm_iomap`**: maps MMIO through `memspace::iomap_device`;
  automatically `iounmap`s on probe failure or device remove.
- **`device.devm_request_irq`**: adapts the devres IRQ handler into a
  `kirq` shared action registered on the `kirq` IRQ core action list.
- **`device.devm_request_threaded_irq` /
  `device.devm_request_threaded_irq_default`**: bind devres primary/thread
  handlers to the provider contract. The current mainline
  `device-res-xkernel` provider does not yet cover the threaded IRQ
  methods, so they return `DriverError::Unsupported`; a later kirq
  threadirq branch will supply the xkernel implementation.
  `device-res-xkernel` is the adaptation layer between devres IRQ
  resources and the kernel IRQ core, translating `device_res`
  trigger/controller/event/handler values into `kirq`'s own types; `kirq`
  does not depend back on devres.
  Future IRQ core capability extensions belong in `kirq`; the driver
  framework exposes kernel IRQ capability to drivers only through this
  adapter.
- **`device.devm_alloc_coherent`**: allocates a coherent DMA buffer via
  `kdma::allocate_dma_memory`; release calls
  `kdma::deallocate_dma_memory`.
- **`resource_provider().monotonic_time`**: only X-Kernel glue passes
  `device_res::TimeOp` into reusable drivers; concrete drivers must not
  call `khal::time` directly.

Release runs in reverse acquisition order (LIFO) so resource dependencies
are never inverted.

### IRQ dispatch mechanism

`device-res-xkernel::XKernelResourceProvider` keeps no local IRQ line
state. It converts `device_res::IrqResource` into `kirq::IrqSpec`, wraps
`device_res::IrqHandler` as `kirq::IrqHandler`, and registers with the IRQ
core per API:

1. `request_irq` calls `kirq::try_register_shared()`; `kirq` allocates a
   line-local `IrqActionToken` and stores the action identity; the provider
   returns `device_res::IrqHandlerToken::SharedAction(id)` to devres.
2. `request_threaded_irq` / `request_threaded_irq_default` currently reuse
   the `device_res::IrqOp` default implementations, returning
   `Unsupported` until a kirq threadirq provider override lands.
3. When an interrupt arrives, `kirq` snapshots the actions from
   `IrqDescRuntimeState`, invokes each handler in order, and passes the
   resolved `virq` as the handler argument. Each wrapper then converts the
   devres handler's `device_res::IrqEvent` into `kirq::IrqEvent`.
4. After the whole line's fanout, `kirq` merges the source bitmap and
   `kirq::notify` wakes line/source waiters directly. `kdriver` installs
   no dispatch hook and takes no part in the async wake bridge.
5. `release_irq` calls `kirq::free_irq_action()` for shared hardirq
   tokens, removing only the action belonging to this devres handler.

Registration and release paths may allocate; the IRQ dispatch path does
not allocate from the heap.

## Concurrency Model

- `DeviceManager::bus_mgr` uses `SpinNoPreempt`: bus enumeration, rescan,
  quiesce, and remove run in process context with mutual exclusion.
- `EnumerationContext` has no interior locking: it is a single-threaded
  bridge between bus backends and probe, filled only inside the `bus_mgr`
  lock.
- IRQ action fanout, threaded wake/ONESHOT, token teardown, and
  `in_flight` synchronization are owned by `kirq`; `device-res-xkernel`
  only stores the mapping from devres tokens to `kirq` release calls, and
  `kdriver` keeps no IRQ core state.
- `PCI_BAR_ALLOCATOR` uses `SpinNoPreempt`: BAR allocation happens only in
  process context (enumeration or probe).
- The `kdevice` shared core's internal locks are managed by the `kdevice`
  crate itself; `kdriver` never holds them directly.

## Design Decisions

### Descriptor-first instead of creating device objects directly

**Choice**: bus enumeration only produces `DeviceDesc` descriptors; it does
not directly create `DeviceObject`s.

**Trade-off**: one extra intermediate representation and a batched probe
step, in exchange for:

- unmatched descriptors never pay `DeviceObject` memory or devres costs;
- all descriptors are collected before probing, making unmatched-device
  logging and diagnosis a single summary;
- descriptor deduplication (e.g. ACPI and DT describing the same device)
  can be implemented before probe.

**Rejected alternative**: the Linux `device_register` model — register at
enumeration. It creates device objects during discovery, simplifying the
code path, but couples registration to matching in time (drivers must be
loaded before device registration). With all x-kernel drivers built in,
descriptor-first is simpler.

### Bus backends as a trait instead of compile-time branches

**Choice**: PCI and platform buses are separate implementations of the
`BusBackend` trait, registered in `default_bus_manager()`.

**Trade-off**: the minor dynamic-dispatch cost of `Box<dyn BusBackend>`, in
exchange for:

- one kernel image supports PCI and platform devices simultaneously — no
  compile-time either/or;
- a new bus type (USB, I2C, ...) is one `BusBackend` implementation plus
  registration, with no `BusManager` core changes;
- backend lifecycle management (init/enumerate/rescan/quiesce/remove) is
  unified in `BusManager`, removing per-backend scheduling boilerplate.

**Rejected alternative**: `cfg` branches hard-coding one bus type inside
`BusManager`. No dispatch overhead, but no multi-bus support, and every new
bus edits `BusManager` internals.

### PCI BARs configured once at enumeration

**Choice**: the PCI backend completes BAR allocation and command-register
configuration during enumeration.

**Trade-off**: slightly longer enumeration (the endpoint list is walked
twice — collect, then configure), in exchange for a pure-read activation
path:

- `configure_pci_device_if_needed` degrades to a no-op at activation since
  BARs are already non-zero;
- the activation path never re-derives the firmware MMIO window
  (`pci_bar_allocation_range`);
- a configuration failure skips the device at enumeration, so no
  unconfigured `DeviceDesc` is ever created.

**Rejected alternative**: deferring configuration — allocate BARs at
driver probe. It avoids useless work for unprobed devices but complicates
probe (which would hold the PCI bus lock and BAR allocator lock) and
requires rolling back a registered `DeviceObject` mid-probe on failure.

### VirtIO PCI/MMIO dual descriptors

**Choice**: each VirtIO device type yields two `DeviceDriver` descriptors
(PCI and MMIO), registered on their respective bus types.

**Trade-off**: twice the descriptor count (6 device types × 2 = 12), in
exchange for:

- the matcher (`VirtioTypeMatcher`) works on the VirtIO type code rather
  than PCI vendor/device ids or DT compatibles, so devices discovered via
  PCI and MMIO both match the same functional driver;
- the PCI vs MMIO activation differences are sealed inside
  `activate_virtio_pci` / `activate_virtio_mmio`; the upper
  `dispatch_virtio_try_new` is fully transport-agnostic.

**Rejected alternative**: one descriptor with runtime transport detection.
Fewer descriptors, but the matcher would compare bus type and VirtIO type
together, and `probe_device` would branch between two transport init
logics.

### IRQ handlers reach kirq through device-res-xkernel

**Choice**: `device-res-xkernel` is the `device_res` provider adapting
driver devres IRQ requests onto `kirq`; `kirq` keeps the shared action
list per IRQ line and manages devres handler lifetimes via tokens.

**Trade-off**: shared IRQ fanout moved from `kdriver` down into `kirq`,
making IRQ core action state more complex; but:

- shared, oneshot, threaded IRQ, per-action stats, and free/synchronize
  semantics all concentrate in the IRQ core;
- device handlers carry their own context — no per-slot trampolines and no
  global IRQ count limit;
- tokens allow freeing one shared handler while other devices on the line
  keep receiving interrupts;
- fixed-length action snapshots keep the dispatch path allocation-free;
- interrupt release removes a device handler by token; after the last
  handler goes, `kirq` masks and tears down the line.

**Rejected alternative**: a preallocated static `IrqSlot` array with
generated trampolines. That would need slot identity bookkeeping and a
hard-coded total IRQ limit.

## Drop / Resource Release

- devres resources are released in LIFO order in the `DeviceObject` remove
  path.
- `PciBackend` holds no persistent resources needing drop-time release
  (`PciBus` is released when `enumerate` returns).
- `PlatformBackend` holds only a `LocalIdAlloc` (a stack `u16`), with no
  explicit release.
- Interrupt release removes the device handler by token; once the last
  handler goes, the `kirq` handler is deregistered.
- Shared DMA buffers are reclaimed by `kdma::deallocate_dma_memory` after
  the last handle drops.

`any_firmware_driver` is an umbrella feature: true whenever any DT/ACPI
platform driver is enabled; `cfg(feature = "any_firmware_driver")`
replaces the verbose `any(ahci, bcm2835-sdhci, sdmmc, fxmac)` condition.
