//! [x-kernel] device drivers.
//!
//! The primary entry point is [`init_drivers`], which runs discovery and
//! probes drivers against long-lived device objects. Drivers publish runtime
//! devices into typed `kclass` registries.
//!
//! Device categories live in the typed `kclass` layer.
//!
//! Initialization has three deliberately separate paths:
//!
//! - Platform `early_driver_init` brings up timer, IRQ, and boot console pieces
//!   that must work before the generic driver model can enumerate descriptors.
//! - The descriptor-first path enumerates buses, matches registered drivers,
//!   probes unpublished `DeviceObject`s, then publishes active runtime devices.
//! - The adoption path is reserved for early devices that are already running
//!   but still need a runtime device-model object, such as the boot console.
//!
//! Supports static and dynamic device models via the `dyn` feature.
