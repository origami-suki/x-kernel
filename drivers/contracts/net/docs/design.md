# net — Design

## Purpose

`net` defines the core contract between NIC drivers and the network subsystem:
the `NetDevice` trait that a NIC driver implements, the `NetRxScheduler` hook
the network stack attaches to interrupt-driven drivers, and the pooled
`NetBuf` buffer family exchanged across that boundary. The crate also
re-exports the shared driver vocabulary (`Device`, `DeviceKind`,
`DriverError`, `DriverResult`) from `driver_base` so that NIC drivers depend
on a single contract crate.

## Responsibilities

- Define `NetDevice`, the operations a NIC driver must provide: address and
  queue capabilities, non-blocking `send`, `recv`, TX/RX recycling, and TX
  buffer allocation.
- Define `NetRxScheduler`, the IRQ-safe receive-scheduling hook stored by
  drivers and invoked after RX interrupt acknowledgement.
- Provide the `NetBuf` / `NetBufHandle` / `NetBufBox` buffer family and the
  fixed-slot `NetBufPool` allocator used for zero-copy packet exchange.
- Provide `MacAddress` as the common NIC hardware address type.

## Non-Responsibilities

- No protocol processing (L3/L4), sockets, or routing: the network stack owns
  all of that. The crate only moves framed byte buffers across the boundary.
- No device discovery, enumeration, or binding: platform code and
  `kdriver` own driver registration and probe.
- No concrete NIC drivers. The `fxmac` and `ixgbe` adapter sources are kept
  in-tree (`src/fxmac.rs`, `src/ixgbe.rs`) but their module declarations and
  features are disabled; they are not part of the built crate.
- No global device registry: a driver backend is reached through the
  `Device` object its implementation lives in.

                                   `NetBufPool` (fixed slots, RAII)
```

- `NetDevice` extends `driver_base::Device`; every NIC driver implements it
  and the network stack is its consumer.
- `NetRxScheduler::schedule_rx` is provided by the network stack, attached
  through `NetDevice::set_rx_scheduler`, and called by the driver from its
  IRQ handler. The hook only records RX work; packet progress stays owned by
  the network stack.
- `NetBuf` is the buffer type; `NetBufBox` (`Box<NetBuf>`) is its RAII form
  and `NetBufHandle` its raw-pointer form for crossing driver interfaces
  without lifetime plumbing.

## Buffer Pool And Lifecycle

`NetBufPool::new(slot_count, buf_len)` allocates one contiguous
`slot_count * buf_len` storage and a free-offset list. Creation rejects a
zero `slot_count` and any `buf_len` outside `1526..=65535` with
`DriverError::InvalidInput`.

- Construction: `alloc_buf` / `alloc_boxed` pop one slot offset from the
  free list and wrap it in a `NetBuf` that keeps an `Arc<NetBufPool>`.
- Use: header and payload regions are addressed by `hdr_len` / `payload_len`
  inside the slot; `set_hdr_len` / `set_payload_len` validate the combined
  frame length against the slot and return `DriverError::InvalidInput` on
  overflow or out-of-bounds sizes.
- Release: `Drop for NetBuf` returns the slot offset to the pool; no manual
  free call exists. `into_handle` / `from_handle` convert between the owned
  and raw-handle forms for drivers that stage buffers in descriptor rings;
  a handle must be consumed by `from_handle` exactly once.

## Execution Context

- `NetRxScheduler` implementations must be safe from hardirq context: no
  sleeping, no hot-path allocation, no callbacks into driver receive paths.
- `NetDevice::send` is non-blocking by contract; `recv` returns
  `DriverError::WouldBlock` when no packet is pending.
- `NetBufPool` allocation takes an internal spin lock and is safe to call
  from any context that may not sleep; the network stack decides where
  buffers are allocated.
- No requirement for a current userspace process, scheduler services, or
  late-boot state; the contract is usable from early driver bring-up.

## Concurrency Model

- `NetBufPool` guards `free_offsets` with `ksync::Mutex`; alloc and release
  are short critical sections. Buffer slots themselves are exclusively owned
  by one `NetBuf` at a time, and mutable access goes through `&mut self`, so
  no additional synchronization is needed on buffer contents.
- `NetDevice` implementations are shared (`&self`) and must make
  queue operations internally synchronized; the contract layer adds none.
- `NetRxScheduler` is `Send + Sync` because it is stored in drivers and
  invoked from interrupt context.

## Error Model

All fallible operations return `driver_base::DriverResult`; no crate-local
error type is defined. Documented failure results:

- `NetBufPool::new` — `DriverError::InvalidInput` for a zero slot count or
  an out-of-range buffer length.
- `NetBuf::set_hdr_len` / `set_payload_len` — `DriverError::InvalidInput`
  when header plus payload overflows or exceeds the slot length.
- `NetDevice::recv` — `DriverError::WouldBlock` when no packet is available.
- `NetDevice::set_rx_scheduler` — default `DriverError::Unsupported` for
  poll-only drivers.

## Design Decisions

- Pooled fixed-slot buffers instead of per-packet heap allocation: kernel
  network paths must not allocate on the hot path; a slot is reused through
  RAII drop, and one contiguous storage keeps DMA-friendly layouts simple.
- Raw `NetBufHandle` instead of `Arc<NetBuf>` on driver interfaces: descriptor
  rings need plain pointers; the single-consumption contract is documented on
  `NetBuf::from_handle` (`# Safety`) rather than paid for on every packet.
- Header/payload split inside one buffer: protocols prepend or strip headers
  without copying the payload, and `frame()` exposes the contiguous view.
- Contract-only crate: hardware knowledge stays in driver crates; keeping the
  dormant `fxmac`/`ixgbe` sources here is historical and they compile only if
  their module declarations and features are re-enabled.
- `driver_base` types are re-exported (not redefined) so the NIC driver
  surface has one import root and error semantics stay defined in one place.
