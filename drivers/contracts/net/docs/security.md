# net — Security And Reliability

## Scope

This analysis covers the entire `net` contract crate: `src/lib.rs` (the
`NetDevice` / `NetRxScheduler` contracts and re-exports) and
`src/net_buf.rs` (the `NetBuf` pool family). The dormant `src/fxmac.rs`
and `src/ixgbe.rs` adapters are not compiled into the crate and are
excluded; they contain no reachable code in this configuration.


## Trust Model

The crate sits between two kernel-side parties: NIC drivers implement the
contracts, and the network stack consumes them. It never touches user
memory, devices, or firmware directly, so it adds no trust boundary of its
own — it hands raw buffers and raw pointers across the boundary and
documents the obligations each side must uphold.

## External Boundaries

- `NetBufHandle` carries raw pointers (`owner_ptr`, `data_ptr`, `data_len`)
  across driver interfaces. Drivers receive these pointers and may only
  round-trip them back through `NetBuf::from_handle` / `recycle_rx`.
- `NetBufPool` storage is kernel heap memory (`Vec<u8>`), never
  device-owned memory; devices write into it only during driver-managed
  DMA.
- No FFI, no inline assembly, no MMIO access: hardware knowledge stays in
  driver crates.

## Unsafe Code

All unsafe code lives in `src/net_buf.rs` (the dormant `fxmac.rs` /
`ixgbe.rs` adapters are not compiled in):

- `NetBuf::get_slice` / `get_slice_mut` — form byte slices at
  `base_ptr().add(start)` inside the pool slot. Safety: `start + len` is
  checked against the slot's `buf_len` (checked arithmetic plus
  `debug_assert`), and `&mut self` excludes concurrent mutable access.
- `NetBufHandle::data` / `data_mut` — dereference the handle's
  `data_ptr` for `data_len` bytes. Safety: the handle was created by
  `into_handle` from a live `NetBuf`, so the pointer range is inside the
  pool allocation; `&mut self` serializes access.
- `NetBuf::from_handle` (`pub unsafe fn`) — `Box::from_raw` on the
  handle's owner pointer. The `# Safety` contract: the handle must have
  been produced by `into_handle` from a live allocation and consumed
  exactly once; forged, stale, or double-consumed handles are undefined
  behavior. This is the one boundary a compromised driver could violate;
  drivers are trusted kernel components.

## Invariants

- Every `NetBuf` slot offset is unique among live buffers; the pool's free
  list never hands out the same offset twice before release.
- A slot's contents are exclusively owned by its `NetBuf`; mutable access
  requires `&mut self`.
- Frame lengths stay within the slot: `set_hdr_len` / `set_payload_len`
  reject header+payload overflow (`DriverError::InvalidInput`).
- Buffer lifetime is RAII: `Drop` returns the offset to the pool, so a
  dropped buffer is immediately reusable but never aliased.

## Threat Analysis

| ID | Threat | Impact | Trigger | Existing control |
|----|--------|--------|---------|------------------|
| T-01 | Forged or double-consumed `NetBufHandle` | High — UB via `Box::from_raw` | A driver fabricates a handle or recycles one twice | Documented single-consumption `# Safety` contract on `from_handle`; drivers are in-crate trusted code. Residual risk accepted by the driver trust model. |
| T-02 | Out-of-bounds header/payload sizing | Medium — out-of-bounds slice access | Caller sets `hdr_len + payload_len` beyond the slot | Checked arithmetic and `DriverError::InvalidInput` in `set_hdr_len`/`set_payload_len` before any slice is formed. |
| T-03 | Device writes past its buffer into the pool | High — corruption of neighboring slots | Mis-programmed DMA on the device side | Out of scope here: drivers size DMA descriptors from slot geometry; the pool keeps one slot per buffer to bound the blast radius. Residual risk sits with the driver/device boundary. |
| T-04 | Unbounded pool exhaustion | Low — allocation failure, no progress | All slots checked out and dropped buffers leaked | RAII drop returns slots deterministically; `alloc_buf` returns `None` instead of blocking or panicking. |

## Failure Modes

| ID | Failure mode | Local effect | System effect | Severity | Handling |
|----|--------------|--------------|---------------|----------|----------|
| F-01 | Pool exhausted (`alloc_buf` → `None`) | Caller cannot allocate a buffer | Packet drop / backpressure at the caller | 3 | Callers retry or drop; no blocking in the pool. |
| F-02 | Invalid pool parameters in `NetBufPool::new` | `DriverError::InvalidInput` | Driver init fails, device not registered | 3 | Explicit validation of slot count and buffer length range. |
| F-03 | `set_rx_scheduler` on a poll-only driver | `DriverError::Unsupported` | Network stack falls back to polling | 4 | Default trait implementation documents the condition. |

## Known Limitations

- Buffer contents are not zeroed on allocation or recycle; drivers must
  treat buffer contents as uninitialized and must not leak stale kernel
  data into transmitted frames.
- The handle type cannot structurally prevent misuse; the safety argument
  rests on the documented driver-side contract.

## Audit Checklist

- Every `unsafe` block in `net_buf.rs` still matches the bounds described
  above (slot-checked, single-consumption).
- No new public API exposes raw pointers without a `# Safety` section.
- Pool slot geometry (offset, length) still passes the `InvalidInput`
  validation path.
