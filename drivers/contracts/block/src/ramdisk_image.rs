//! Embedded filesystem image backing a static RAM disk.
//!
//! Active only under the `ramdisk-static` feature. The image path is supplied
//! at build time through the `XKERNEL_RAMDISK_IMG` environment variable, which
//! the crate's `build.rs` turns into a `cargo:rustc-env`. The Makefile sets it
//! from the `RAMDISK_IMG` variable (defaulting to an empty EXT4 image built
//! by `make ramdisk_img`, but any FAT/ext4 image may be substituted).
//!
//! The image bytes live in a 512-byte-aligned, writable static so that
//! [`crate::ramdisk_static::RamDisk`] can use them directly as a zero-copy
//! block backend. Because the root filesystem is mounted read-write, the
//! backing storage must be mutable, so the static is placed in `.data`; the
//! embedded image therefore grows the kernel binary by roughly the image size.
