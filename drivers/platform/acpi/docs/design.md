# acpi — Design

## Purpose

`acpi` provides early-boot read access to ACPI firmware description: it
locates the RSDP, walks XSDT/RSDT to find tables by signature, and extracts
the platform facts the kernel needs before its own drivers run — CPU/IO APIC
topology (MADT), PCI ECAM windows (MCFG), the PCI host bridge memory window
(DSDT `_CRS` scan), and the power-off register (FADT PM1a control block).

## Responsibilities

- Own the boot-time RSDP address: `init(rsdp_addr)` stores it in a
  crate-global slot, `desc()` / `rsdp_addr()` read it back.
- Validate and dereference firmware tables: RSDP signature and checksums
  (basic and extended), SDT header signature, length, and checksum.
- Parse MADT into `MadtInfo` plus a `MadtEntryIter` over
  `LocalApic` / `IoApic` entries, and derive `ApicInfo` summaries.
- Parse MCFG into `McfgAllocation` (first segment-0 allocation) and compute
  the ECAM `(base, size)` range per bus shift of 1 MiB.
- Best-effort scan of the DSDT for the PCI host bridge `_CRS` memory window
  (`PciHostMemWindow`).
- Extract the FADT PM1a control block (`Pm1aControlBlock`) for the power-off
  path, preferring the ACPI 2.0+ `X_PM1a_CNT_BLK` GAS and falling back to the
  legacy 32-bit `PM1a_CNT_BLK` field.

## Non-Responsibilities

- No AML interpretation: the DSDT scan is a bounded byte-pattern search
  documented as advisory, not a namespace evaluator.
- No runtime ACPI events, no GPE handling, no hotplug notification, no
  power-state transitions: only read-only boot-time table extraction, plus
  the PM1a port description consumed elsewhere for power-off.
- No device instantiation: platform init code turns the parsed facts into
  platform devices; this crate returns plain data.
- No MMIO mapping: tables are read through the direct physical mapping
  (`kaddr_layout::PAGE_OFFSET`); mapping new regions is not this crate's job.

## Architecture

Single-file crate in three layers:

```text
boot firmware -> init(rsdp_addr) -> LazyInit<AcpiDesc> (global RSDP slot)
                       |
        find_table* / find_madt* / find_mcfg / find_*_from_init
                       |
   validate_rsdp -> XSDT (rev >= 2) preferred, RSDT fallback
                       |
   validate_sdt_header (signature/length/checksum)
                       |
   typed reads: MADT iter | MCFG entries | DSDT byte scan | FADT offsets
```

Public data types (`AcpiDesc`, `AcpiTableHeader`, `MadtInfo`, `ApicInfo`,
`McfgAllocation`, `PciHostMemWindow`, `Pm1aControlBlock`,
`LocalApicEntry`, `IoApicEntry`, `MadtEntry`) are plain `Copy` views;
raw firmware layouts (`Rsdp`, `AcpiSdtHeader`, `McfgEntryRaw`, `Madt*`) are
private `repr(C, packed)` types with compile-time size assertions.

## Execution Context

- Strictly early boot: `init()` must be called by platform init with the
  firmware-passed RSDP address before any lookup; `*_from_init` helpers
  read the global slot afterwards.
- All table reads assume the firmware regions are reachable through the
  direct physical map (`addr_to_ptr` adds `PAGE_OFFSET` to addresses below
  it). No `memspace` device mapping is required or performed.
- No allocator, no threads, no scheduler dependency; callable from a single
  boot thread before kernel services exist.
- `find_pm1a_control_block_from_init` is deliberately reachable from the
  power-off terminal path after other services are torn down and must stay
  panic-free; the other lookups are one-shot boot-time calls.

## Concurrency Model

- One-shot initialization through `lazyinit::LazyInit`: the first
  `init()` wins, later calls with different addresses have no effect.
  Platform init calls it once on the boot hart before APs start.
- After initialization the global descriptor is read-only; all lookup
  functions take no locks and are safe to call concurrently once `init()`
  has completed.

## Error And Panic Model

Two deliberately different regimes:

- Fallible, `Option`/`Result`-valued: `init` returns
  `AcpiInitError::MissingRsdp` for a zero address; `desc`, `rsdp_addr`,
  `find_mcfg`, `find_pci_host_mem_window_from_init`, and
  `find_pm1a_control_block_from_init` return `None` when the described
  feature is absent or unparseable.
- Panicking, for boot-critical firmware corruption: `validate_rsdp` panics
  on a zero address, bad `"RSD PTR "` signature, or checksum failure;
  `find_table` / `find_table_from_rsdp` panic when the RSDP is missing or
  names neither XSDT nor RSDT, when a required table is absent, or when an
  SDT header is too short, mismatched, or fails its checksum; the MADT
  iterator panics on entries that are too short or run past the table end.
  A broken required table aborts boot instead of letting the kernel guess
  a topology.

## Firmware Trust Boundary

Firmware tables are external input and are only partially trusted:

- RSDP: signature plus basic (20-byte) and extended (rev >= 2) checksums.
- Every SDT: header signature, minimum length, and full-table checksum
  before its body is parsed.
- MADT entries: per-entry length checked against the remaining table; unknown
  entry types are skipped.
- PM1a ports: non-zero and `u16`-range checked; ECAM ranges are checked for
  `u64 -> usize` and bus arithmetic overflow (`ecam_region` returns `None`).
- The DSDT byte scan bounds its search windows (16 KiB `_CRS` search, 8 KiB
  resource scan) and validates item lengths before indexing.

What is *not* defendable here: the firmware choosing a wrong-but-valid
table (checksums pass, content lies). Residual risk is accepted; platform
policy decides whether absence (`None`) is fatal.

## Unsafe Code

All unsafe code is concentrated in four private helpers at the bottom of
`src/lib.rs`, each with a `SAFETY:` comment:

- `addr_to_ptr` — maps a firmware address into the direct physical map.
- `ptr_from_addr` — forms a `&'static T` at a validated structure address.
- `bytes_from_addr` / `sdt_bytes` — form byte slices over validated ranges
  (RSDP length, header-declared table length).
- `slice::from_raw_parts` call sites in `find_table_xsdt`, `find_table_rsdt`,
  and `parse_mcfg` — bounded by header lengths validated by
  `validate_sdt_header`.

The soundness contract is: addresses come from the firmware-provided RSDP
chain, every table header is checksum-validated before body access, and
`repr(C, packed)` layouts are pinned by compile-time size assertions.

## Design Decisions

- XSDT preferred, RSDT fallback for RSDP revision >= 2: matches the ACPI
  specification's deprecation of 32-bit entry addresses while keeping
  legacy firmware working.
- Panic on missing boot-critical tables, `Option` for optional features:
  a kernel that guesses CPU topology or ECAM location is worse than one
  that stops loudly; feature probes (MCFG absence, DSDT window) return
  `None` so callers can degrade.
- Panic-free power-off lookup: the PM1a path runs after the kernel is torn
  down, where a panic means a hung machine instead of a clean shutdown.
- Byte-scan instead of an AML interpreter for the PCI host window: QEMU and
  common firmware emit a stable `_CRS` layout; a full AML interpreter is
  out of scope, and the result is documented as advisory.
- Typed `Copy` snapshots instead of retained references: callers cannot
  hold firmware memory across mapping changes, and the crate keeps no
  state beyond the RSDP address.
