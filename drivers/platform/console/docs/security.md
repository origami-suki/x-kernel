# console-driver — Emergency Output Security and Reliability

## Trust Model and External Boundaries

Port construction trusts the platform/device layer to provide valid UART addresses,
mapping lifetimes, and device-tree layouts.
Emergency transmission reads hardware status and writes transmit registers using
byte slices supplied by the kernel.
It does not access user pointers, allocate DMA or ordinary memory, or parse external
configuration at call time.

## Unsafe Code and Memory Safety Invariants

- `SerialPort::new_mmio_pl011` requires a valid window aligned for 32-bit access,
  a mapping that outlives the port, and exclusive initialization.
  The stdout mapping comes from `iomap_device`; auxiliary mappings come from `devm_iomap`.
- `SerialPort::new_mmio_ns16550` and `Port::new` require the same mapping validity;
  register stride and width must match the device.
  Emergency handles reuse fixed values checked during normal construction.
- PL011 volatile accesses in `EmergencyTx::try_send_raw` only touch FR/DR registers,
  without accessing mutable storage owned by Rust.
  NS16550 uses an independent local handle to the same hardware window or I/O ports.
- NMI output does not read, dereference, or forcibly unlock `SpinNoIrq<Backend>`.
  It creates no `&mut Backend` overlapping the interrupted guard's borrow.

## Thread Safety

State outside the lock is immutable after initialization.
Concurrent emergency calls do not race to modify software state, but hardware
transmission has no mutual exclusion guarantee.
Volatile access is not synchronization: characters may interleave, writers may
race for FIFO capacity, and bytes may be lost.
This path provides no Linux nbcon-style ownership arbitration and does not support
concurrent changes to the baud rate or other configuration.

## Threats and Failure Handling

| Risk | Trigger | Mitigation and Residual Limitations |
|------|---------|------------------------------------|
| NMI self-deadlock | Interrupting a normal serial lock holder | Emergency transmission bypasses the port lock and the object it protects. |
| Indefinite transmit wait | FIFO remains full or transmitter remains unready | [`EmergencyTx::send_raw`](../src/serial/emergency.rs) limits polling for each transmitted byte to `TX_POLL_LIMIT = 100_000` attempts. On exhaustion, `EmergencyTx::write_data` returns and discards the remainder of the current byte slice. |
| Hardware access fault | Invalid mapping, powered-off device, or MMIO bus fault | Relies on the port lifetime contract. The polling budget cannot handle an individual bus access that never returns or faults. |
| Interleaved or lost logs | Writers on multiple CPUs, or normal and emergency writers, compete | Best-effort output is accepted; there is no buffering or replay guarantee. |
| Configuration reset | Emergency path reinitializes the UART | Emergency transmission only accesses status and data registers and performs no initialization. |
| Lock reentry during formatting | `Display`/`Debug` acquires a lock | `kprint_atomic!` callers must audit formatting; bypassing the serial lock does not remove this obligation. |

## Privacy and Audit Checklist

Output may contain task names, registers, and kernel addresses.
Visibility depends on access to the physical or virtual console.

- Does each new backend provide emergency transmission without accessing the locked object?
- Do the address, stride, and access width come from the same initialized device?
- Does the timeout path return directly without recursively printing an error?
- Are MMIO/PIO window lifetimes and natural alignment preserved?
- Does the documentation distinguish bypassing ordinary locks from complete, serialized, reliable output?
