# console-driver — Console and Emergency Output Design

## Purpose and Scope

This crate connects `khal::console::ConsoleIf` to the platform UART and shares
the early stdout instance with the runtime serial driver.
This document focuses on the boundary between normal output and NMI emergency output.

- `src/lib.rs`: Resolves stdout, maps MMIO, implements `ConsoleIf`, and registers input IRQs.
- `src/serial.rs`: Defines one `SerialPort` per UART, publishes stdout, and shares instances.
- `src/serial/emergency.rs`: Transmits emergency output without taking ordinary locks.
- `src/ns16550_mmio.rs`: Accesses NS16550 MMIO registers using the stride and width specified by the device tree.
- `src/runtime.rs`: Selects the runtime console and adapts it to a character device.

## Architecture and Algorithms

The runtime-level public entries are `runtime::write_active_console` and
`runtime::read_active_console`: each takes the subsystem lock only to
snapshot the active console handle (`ClassDevice<CharDeviceImpl>`),
releases it, and then calls the handle's `CharDevice::write` /
`CharDevice::read` delegation, which forwards into the owning driver's
`SerialPort::write_data` / `read_data` (driver -> UART). Keeping the
subsystem lock and the per-device lock non-nested is deliberate
(`read_active_console` drops the subsystem lock before the IO call).

```text
runtime::write_active_console -> active_handle -> CharDevice::write
                              -> SerialPort::write_data  -> inner: SpinNoIrq<Backend> -> UART
Emergency output -> SerialPort::write_data_atomic -> EmergencyTx              -> UART
runtime::read_active_console  -> active_handle -> CharDevice::read
                              -> SerialPort::read_data   -> UART
```

Port construction initializes the device and saves its virtual address or I/O-port
base in `EmergencyTx`, outside the lock.
For NS16550 MMIO, it also saves the register stride and access width decoded during
the same construction path.
The stdout instance is published through `LazyInit` after construction;
the early console and runtime driver share one `Arc<SerialPort>`.

Emergency transmission does not access `inner`.
PL011 polls FR and writes DR directly.
NS16550 creates a local register handle containing only fixed address information
and calls the nonblocking `try_send_raw` without initializing the device.
Each transmitted byte is polled at most 100,000 times.
A failure immediately ends output of the current byte slice.
This is an iteration budget, not a wall-clock time guarantee.
Newline and backspace conversions follow the corresponding backend's transmit semantics.

## Calling Constraints and Concurrency

- Normal reads, writes, and input IRQ handling use the port lock and must not be reentered from NMI context.
- Emergency transmission may run in NMI context or while the normal port lock is held.
  It does not allocate or sleep and does not depend on the scheduler, clocks, or IRQ completion.
- MMIO mappings, device power, and transmit configuration must remain valid.
  Emergency transmission does not restore device configuration.
- The emergency path shares only hardware addresses and creates no reference to the locked `Backend`.
- Emergency transmission is not serialized with normal transmission or other CPUs.
  Bytes may interleave or be lost; there is no log buffer, replay, or console ownership takeover protocol.
  This is a best-effort path for diagnostics during shutdown.
- Argument evaluation and `Display`/`Debug` implementations used by `kprint_atomic!`
  must also satisfy the calling context's constraints.

## Lifetime and Validation

`EmergencyTx` does not own a second mapping and does not unmap the device.
A static reference retains the stdout port.
Auxiliary ports follow the device mapping's lifetime; the mapping may be removed
only after all handles have stopped using it.

Regression tests cover routing empty output while both the normal print lock and
serial lock are held, transmission through simulated registers while the port lock
is held, return when hardware remains unready, preservation of configuration
registers, and all three NS16550 access widths.
