# irq-driver — Design

## Purpose

`irq-driver` is the platform interrupt-controller integration layer: it
implements the `kirq::IntrManagerIf` contract for each supported
architecture (GIC v2/v3 on AArch64, PLIC on RISC-V, IO-APIC glue on
x86_64) and owns controller discovery, MMIO mapping, and per-backend
configuration so that `kirq` stays architecture-neutral.

## Responsibilities

- Discover and map the controller: GIC regions from the device tree
  (`config_from_device_tree`), PLIC from its fixed platform address with
  DT confirmation, each mapped through `memspace::iomap_device`.
- Provide `kirq::IntrManagerIf` per architecture: `configure` (trigger
  and polarity), `enable`/disable, `dispatch_irq` (claim-and-handle),
  `dispatch_nmi` (GICv3 PMR-protected path), `complete_irq`,
  `notify_cpu`, and `set_prio`.
- Expose descriptor constructors (`irq_desc`, `level_irq_desc`,
  `edge_irq_desc`, `plic_irq_desc`, `legacy_irq_desc`) so platform init
  builds correctly rooted `IrqDesc`s (`GIC_ROOT_DOMAIN`, `PLIC_DOMAIN`,
  `IO_APIC_DOMAIN`).
- Expose GIC-specific NMI capability queries (`supports_hardware_nmi`,
  `set_nmi_attr`).

## Non-Responsibilities

- No IRQ policy: vector allocation, priorities, and handler registries
  belong to `kirq`; backends only program what `kirq` decides.
- No device discovery: the controller nodes are found by this crate, but
  device IRQ wiring is platform init's job.
- No x86 I/O-APIC register access: `src/x86.rs` delegates to the
  `x86-apic` crate and only translates `IrqDesc` trigger/polarity.
- No software interrupt routing between CPUs beyond the backend's
  `notify_cpu`.

## Execution Context

- `init` / `init_from_device_tree` run once during platform bring-up,
  before device interrupts are enabled; `init_current_cpu` runs per CPU.
- `dispatch_irq` runs in IRQ context with interrupts enabled; the GICv3
  NMI path (`dispatch_nmi`) runs with interrupts disabled and no NMI
  window, relying on PMR protection.
- Backend registers are accessed under `SpinNoIrq` locks inside the
  backends; no allocator and no sleeping anywhere in the crate.

## Concurrency Model

- Backend state (`GIC`, `PLIC`) lives in `LazyInit<SpinNoIrq<..>>`;
  `init` is idempotent (a second call returns).
- `remember_config` asserts that a re-supplied GIC configuration is
  byte-identical to the initialized one, catching inconsistent platform
  init instead of silently reprogramming.
- PLIC claim/complete pairs are guarded by the same lock as enablement.

## Error And Panic Model

- Absence is `Option`: no controller node in the device tree, or too few
  `reg` regions for the detected version, yields `None` so the platform
  can fall back or abort with its own policy.
- MMIO mapping failures panic with the region name
  (`map_mmio_region`), and `remember_config` panics on a changed config —
  both are bring-up ordering/configuration bugs, not runtime conditions.
- PLIC access before initialization panics via the named `expect` on the
  global handle.

## Design Decisions

- One crate per architecture via `cfg` dispatch instead of trait
  objects: each target compiles only its own backend, and `kirq` sees a
  uniform `IntrManagerIf` provider either way.
- GIC discovery walks the device tree for an
  `interrupt-controller` node whose compatible strings map to a known
  version, then takes as many `reg` regions as that version requires
  (v2: GICD+GICC; v3: GICD+GICR) — matching the hardware layout instead
  of hard-coding addresses.
- The GICv3 NMI path is a separate `dispatch_nmi` entry: claim-time
  IRQ/NMI classification happens in the backend, keeping the PMR-based
  NMI window logic out of `kirq`.
- PLIC keeps Linux-style constant IRQ bases (`S_SOFT`/`S_TIMER`/
  `S_EXT` offsets above the `INTC_IRQ_BASE` sentinel) and a skip
  sentinel for completion, since timer and IPI events need no PLIC
  claim/complete.
