# kiface Security Notes

## Scope

This analysis covers the entire crate: `src/lib.rs` (the two public
attribute macros) and its private modules `src/args.rs`, `src/interface.rs`,
`src/provide.rs`, `src/naming.rs`, `src/errors.rs`, and `src/validator.rs`,
including the code those macros generate. The test fixtures under
`test_crates/` are separate crates exercised only by `cargo test --doc`
and are excluded from this analysis; they contain no production wiring.
External responsibility: the macros emit no runtime component, so runtime
isolation, scheduling, and memory safety of provider bodies belong to the
crates that write them.

## Unsafe And FFI Boundary

The crate itself is safe Rust, but its macros generate the kernel's
one-symbol-per-method FFI boundary (all in the expansion of the two
attributes):

- Interface side (`src/interface.rs`): a hidden module containing an
  `unsafe extern "Rust"` block whose functions carry
  `#[link_name = "__kiface_{namespace}_{Interface}_{method}"]`, plus one
  facade method per interface method containing
  `unsafe { extern_fn(args) }` with a `SAFETY:` comment.
- Provider side (`src/provide.rs`): each method is emitted as
  `#[unsafe(export_name = "__kiface_{namespace}_{Interface}_{method}")]
  extern "Rust" fn ...` with its original body.

Safety of the generated unsafe rests on two locally checked facts:
(1) `src/provide.rs` emits a `const _: fn(arg_types) -> output =
Interface::method;` type-check per method, so a provider that does not
match the facade signature fails to compile on the provider side; and
(2) both symbol names derive from the same `src/naming.rs` rule
(`__kiface_{namespace}_{Interface}_{method}`), so the definition and
provider sides can only meet when namespace, interface name, and method
name agree. The remaining risk is linking more or fewer than one provider,
covered by the invariants below.

`kiface` is a build-time wiring mechanism. It does not provide an isolation
boundary; all providers run in the same kernel address space as their callers.

## Invariants

- Each interface method must have exactly one linked provider.
- The provider method signature must match the facade method signature.
- The final image must include the provider crate whenever an interface method is
  called.
- Interface methods must not rely on registration order or multiple providers.

Duplicate providers for the same interface method export the same symbol and
should fail during linking. Missing providers fail when the generated facade call
references an unresolved symbol.

`optional` interfaces are reserved but not implemented. They must not silently
reuse the required-interface path, because that would turn an expected
best-effort dependency into a hard link dependency.

## Current Restrictions

The first `interface` implementation rejects generics, receivers, unsafe
methods, async methods, extern methods, variadic methods, and default bodies.
These restrictions keep the generated ABI surface small while the crate is used
to replace existing single-provider `crate_interface` and accidental `linkme`
entry wiring.
