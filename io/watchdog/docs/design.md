# io/watchdog — Soft and Hard Lockup Watchdog Design

## Purpose

`io/watchdog` provides X-Kernel's soft-lockup and hard-lockup detection:

- Soft lockup: A watchdog task on each CPU periodically updates a timestamp;
  a timer callback checks whether that timestamp has expired.
- Hard lockup: NMI support (the `nmi` feature) periodically checks whether the local
  CPU's timer interrupt count is still advancing.
  A failed check triggers a global rendezvous, collects snapshots, and panics.

Dependencies: `khal` (NMI, per-CPU state, and time), `ktask` (tasks, timer callbacks,
and snapshots), and `ktime_types`.

## Background

The system may become unresponsive when interrupts remain masked or tasks are not
scheduled for an extended period.
Soft-lockup detection depends on scheduling and timers, which may themselves be affected.
Hard-lockup detection uses an NMI source independent of ordinary IRQs and can still
run when ordinary interrupts have stopped entirely.
X-Kernel uses the PMU cycle counter as its NMI source through `kplat::NmiPeriodic`;
this crate is the NMI consumer.

## Scope

- `src/init.rs`: `init_primary`, `init_secondary`, `init_common`, `init_nmi_watchdog`, and `init_softlockup_detection`.
- `src/lockup_detection.rs`: Per-CPU `LockupDetection` state, thresholds, and the `WatchdogTask` implementation.
- `src/watchdog_task.rs`: The `WatchdogTask` trait, per-CPU task queues, and mutex deadlock checks.
- `src/rendezvous.rs`: The global rendezvous state machine triggered by a failed check.
- `src/lib.rs`: Exports.

## Calling Constraints and Execution Context

| Entry Point | Execution Context | Constraints |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------|
| `init_primary` / `init_secondary` | Primary / secondary CPU boot | Once per CPU. |
| `init_nmi_watchdog` | Boot, with the NMI feature | Checks `khal::nmi::mode()`; logs and disables hard-lockup detection when it returns `None`. |
| NMI callback registered through `enable_periodic_nmi` | NMI context | Only NMI-safe operations: atomics, snapshots, and `kprint_atomic!`, including lock-free argument formatting. Ordinary IRQ spinlocks are forbidden. |
| Timer callback (`timer_tick` / soft-lockup check) | Timer interrupt, with IRQs disabled | Per-CPU atomic accesses. |
| Watchdog task | One task pinned to each CPU | Only updates the soft-lockup timestamp and sleeps for 4 seconds. |

## State Machines

### Per-CPU Hard-Lockup Detection

`hrtimer_interrupts`, incremented by timer interrupts, is compared with
`hrtimer_interrupts_saved`, the value observed by the previous NMI check.
If the count has been initialized but has not advanced, the hard-lockup condition
holds: `check_hardlockup` returns `true`.
`WatchdogTask::check` negates this result, so a healthy task returns `true`.

### Global Rendezvous

```text
Idle      -- try_trigger (first failing CPU transitions atomically) --> Triggered
Triggered -- mark_arrived in each CPU's NMI -----------------------> wait for all_arrived_mask
Triggered -- initiating CPU collects/prints snapshots, mark_dump_done --> DumpDone
DumpDone  -- initiating CPU panics (system stops) -----------------> terminal state
```

`reset()` provides a path back to Idle.
Its comment warns that other CPUs may still be spinning in NMI context, so callers
must use it carefully.

## Algorithms

### Hard-Lockup Check on Each NMI

1. `check_watchdog_tasks()` scans the local CPU's queue (`HardLockupDetection` and
   `MutexDeadlock`) and returns the task name when a check fails.
2. On failure, if `ktask::snapshot::nmi_begin()` succeeds, call `rv::try_trigger()`.
   The CPU that wins the atomic compare-and-swap from Idle to Triggered becomes
   the initiating CPU.
3. Each CPU calls `mark_arrived` and `nmi_collect_local()` in its own NMI context.
4. After `wait_all_arrived_strong()`, the initiating CPU prints the failure,
   calls `nmi_dump_all` and `mark_dump_done`, and panics.
   Other CPUs spin while waiting for `is_dump_done`.

### Soft-Lockup Detection

- The watchdog task pinned to each CPU calls `touch_softlockup` every 4 seconds.
- On every tick, the timer callback calls `timer_tick()` and checks
  `now - soft_timestamp > 20s`.
  When the threshold is exceeded, it logs the failure and calls `dump_sched_stats`
  and `dump_cpu_tasks`, with reports rate-limited by the threshold interval.

## Concurrency

- `LockupDetection` is per-CPU state with atomic fields (`AtomicU64`, `AtomicU32`,
  and `AtomicBool`), allowing concurrent access from NMIs and timer interrupts.
- `WATCHDOG_TASK_QUEUE` is a per-CPU `Vec`.
  Registration occurs only during per-CPU initialization, when migration is impossible;
  NMI handlers only traverse it for reading.
- The rendezvous uses global atomics (`PHASE`, `CAUSE_CPU`, and `ARRIVED_BITMAP`)
  and spinning, without taking locks in NMI context.
- NMI paths never acquire ordinary IRQ spinlocks, avoiding self-deadlock when a
  pseudo-NMI preempts a lock holder on the same CPU.

## Design Decisions

- **Thresholds:** 20 seconds for soft lockups and 10 seconds for hard lockups.
  The watchdog task updates its timestamp every 4 seconds, providing five chances
  within the 20-second threshold to avoid false reports.
- **Strong rendezvous without a timeout:** The initiating CPU waits for every CPU
  before dumping snapshots, avoiding missing CPU snapshots.
  If any CPU cannot enter NMI context, the wait is permanent; this is accepted
  because the system is already unusable.
- **Explicit degradation when NMI is unavailable:** Boot logs state that hard-lockup
  detection is disabled, rather than failing silently.
- **Snapshot reentry protection:** If `nmi_begin()` fails because another snapshot
  is in progress, skip the current dump.
- **Soft-lockup report rate limit:** At most one report per threshold interval.

## Drop and Resource Release

Per-CPU state lives as long as the kernel and is not released at runtime.
`reset()` is used only when the rendezvous needs to be restarted.
