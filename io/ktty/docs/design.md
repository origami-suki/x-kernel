# ktty — Design

## Purpose

`ktty` implements the X-Kernel terminal layer: terminal devices, the line
discipline, pseudo-terminals, and the POSIX job-control interface. The
device-file layer forwards `/dev/console`, `/dev/tty`, and PTY requests to
this crate; process, process-group, and session identity stay owned by
`kprocess`.

## Scope

- `src/terminal/job.rs`: controlling-terminal session association, the
  foreground process group, and foreground-change notification.
- `src/terminal/ldisc.rs`: input processing, canonical mode, and signal
  character handling.
- `src/terminal/termios.rs`: the `Termios` terminal attribute layout and
  flag/character constants shared by the ioctl boundary.
- `src/tty/mod.rs`: TTY file operations and the `TC*`/`TIOC*` ioctl
  boundary.
- `src/tty/ntty.rs`, `src/tty/pty.rs`: the console TTY and PTY backends.

## Non-Responsibilities

- No terminal device drivers: UART hardware belongs to the console/serial
  drivers; `ktty` consumes byte streams through the TTY backend trait.
- No process, session, or credential ownership: sessions and process
  groups live in `kprocess`; `ktty` only holds weak references and asks
  it to resolve PGIDs.
- No pseudo-terminal allocation policy: `/dev/ptmx` open-path decisions
  belong to the devfs/pty layers; `ktty` implements the master/slave
  data path and job-control semantics.
- No signal delivery policy: control characters that generate signals
  are turned into `ksignal` requests by the line discipline; `ktty`
  does not decide delivery.
- No user-memory policy: user pointers appear only at the ioctl boundary
  and are copied through the checked user-access helpers.

## Controlling Terminal State

`TIOCSCTTY` only lets a session leader acquire the controlling terminal.
On a successful bind, `ktty` simultaneously:

1. installs the controlling-terminal object in `kprocess::Session`;
2. records the same session in `JobControl`;
3. makes the caller's process group the initial foreground process group.

This matches Linux's observable behavior after acquiring a controlling
terminal, so a shell started afterwards obtains a valid foreground PGID
through `TIOCGPGRP`.

Known limitation: Linux's privileged cross-session forced acquisition
(`TIOCSCTTY` with `arg == 1`) is not implemented; that request returns
`EPERM`, and other non-zero `arg` values return `EINVAL` (see the Known
Limitations section of `docs/security.md`). If any step fails, the newly installed
session/terminal state is rolled back. A per-TTY association-transaction
lock serializes bind, unbind, and rollback, preventing an older
transaction from undoing a newer successful binding on the same TTY.

`TIOCSPGRP` reads the target PGID from user space, resolves the target
process group in the process table, and requires:

- the caller to belong to the session associated with the controlling
  terminal;
- the target process group to belong to the same session.

`TIOCGPGRP` and `TIOCGSID` return state only to callers in the session of
the controlling terminal; cross-session queries get `ENOTTY`. As in
Linux, a PTY master may query the job-control state of its paired slave.
Explicit foreground changes and the initial controlling-terminal bind
share `JobControl::set_foreground`, which wakes readers waiting for
foreground state changes on success.

TTY `open` also implements Linux's implicit controlling-terminal
acquisition: when `O_NOCTTY` is not set, the current user process is a
session leader, and no controlling TTY exists yet, the opened terminal
becomes the controlling terminal through the same `bind_to` flow and
initializes the foreground. PTY masters never take part in implicit or
explicit controlling-terminal binding; only a slave can become a
controlling TTY. Opens issued by kernel threads have no user session and
therefore never trigger the transition; a boot script's fallback shell
re-opens `/dev/console` in user mode.

## Calling Constraints

TTY ioctl paths require the current task to be a user-process thread,
because permission and session checks depend on `current_user_thread()`.
User pointers are read or written only at the ioctl boundary; internal
job-control logic receives only kernel-held PGIDs, `Session`, and
`ProcessGroup` values. The ioctl path must not be called from interrupt
context. TTY `open` may be called from kernel threads; in that case only
the file open completes and no controlling-terminal assignment is
attempted.

## Concurrency Model

The controlling-terminal session and foreground are each protected by
`SpinNoIrq`; a per-TTY association-transaction lock protects the
multi-phase binds and unbinds that span `Session`, `JobControl`, and the
foreground. State updates never cross a potentially blocking operation;
after a foreground change, waiters are woken through `PollSet`.
