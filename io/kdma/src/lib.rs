//! DMA allocation helpers and bus address types.
//!
//! `kdma` is the kernel's DMA memory layer: [`allocate_dma_memory`] and
//! [`deallocate_dma_memory`] manage coherent, device-reachable memory;
//! [`map_dma_buffer`] / [`unmap_dma_buffer`] stage ordinary buffers
//! through a coherent bounce pool for temporary transactions; [`p2b`] /
//! [`b2p`] convert between physical and bus addresses. See
//! `docs/design.md` for the full boundary contracts.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! Map a driver-owned buffer for a device read (DeviceToDriver), then
//! unmap it once the device is done. Kernel code only; this crate cannot
//! compile in a host doctest environment, so the example is `ignore`.
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use core::ptr::NonNull;
//! use kdma::{map_dma_buffer, unmap_dma_buffer, DmaDirection};
//!
//! # fn stage(buffer: NonNull<[u8]>) -> Result<(), alloc_engine::AllocError> {
//! // 1. Stage the driver-owned buffer through the coherent bounce pool.
//! let dma = unsafe { map_dma_buffer(buffer, DmaDirection::DeviceToDriver) }?;
//!
//! // 2. Program the device with dma.bus_addr and wait for completion.
//! // device.submit(dma.bus_addr, buffer.len());
//!
//! // 3. Unmap exactly once with the same address and buffer.
//! unsafe { unmap_dma_buffer(dma.bus_addr, buffer, DmaDirection::DeviceToDriver) };
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! For persistent device-reachable memory (descriptor rings, shared
//! queues), use [`allocate_dma_memory`] instead, which returns a
//! [`DMAInfo`] whose bus address stays valid until
//! [`deallocate_dma_memory`].
