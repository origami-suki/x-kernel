# kvmm-api design

## Purpose

`kvmm-api` is the control-plane (policy) crate for the VMM. The [`kvmm`] crate
provides only *mechanism* — `Vm`, `Vcpu`, guest memory, and the virtual-device
substrate — with no opinion on how a VM is created or destroyed. `kvmm-api`
supplies the devices that make those decisions, so that VM lifetime is easy to
reason about in one place.

Keeping policy out of `kvmm` means the mechanism crate has no global
lifecycle state to audit: a `Vm` lives exactly as long as some `kvmm-api`
owner holds it.

## Devices

### `KvmmVmDevice` — fd-bound VM instance (`/dev/kvmm-vm`)

The problem it solves: VM lifetime must be owned by a real userspace process,
not by a transient write command. Without an owning file description there is no
natural point at which to tear a VM down.

`KvmmVmDevice` ties one VM to one open file description:

| VFS event      | Action                                                                 |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `open`         | install a fresh idle `VmInstance` in the file's private data           |
| first `write`  | parse `bootlinux [kernel dtb initrd] [@0xBASE]`, boot the VM           |
| later `write`s | push bytes into the guest UART RX FIFO (console input)                 |
| `read`         | drain the guest UART TX channel (guest console output)                 |
| `release`      | request vCPU stop, join vCPU threads, drop the VM (frees guest memory) |

`VmInstance` holds `ksync::Mutex<InstanceState>` where `InstanceState` is
`Idle` or `Running(Vm<CurrentArch>)`. The mutex gives `open` a placeholder
that a later `write` fills in, without threading the VM through the file
builder.

The device relies on two mechanism features:

* `DeviceFileOps::release` (kvfs) — the close hook, forwarded from
  `VfsFile::drop` through the character-device `FileOperations` shim. Without
  it there is no place to tear a per-fd VM down.
* `Vm::stop_and_join` / `VmShared::request_stop` (kvmm) — the cooperative vCPU
  stop path. `request_stop` sets a flag checked at the top of the vCPU run loop
  and wakes any vCPU parked in WFI; `stop_and_join` then joins each vCPU
  thread. Only after every vCPU thread has exited does the last
  `Arc<VmShared>` drop, releasing the second-stage page table.
  The vCPU thread drops its local `Vcpu` before calling `ktask::exit`, because
  that exit path does not unwind the closure stack.

## Teardown ordering

```
release
  └─ Vm::stop_and_join
       ├─ VmShared::request_stop      (set stop flag, interrupt vCPU tasks)
       └─ for each vcpu_task: join()  (block until the thread leaves the loop)
  └─ *state = Idle                    (drop Vm → last Arc<VmShared> → GStage Drop)
```

A vCPU that never exits guest mode (a tight guest loop taking no traps) will
not observe the stop request until its next exit — a timer tick guarantees
this in practice for Linux guests.

## Scope

* riscv64 and aarch64 Linux boot are implemented. On other architectures the
  boot command logs and returns an error; the crate still compiles so the
  workspace builds on every target.
* This crate owns the Linux boot control plane, including image loading and DTB
  patching. The `kvmm` crate keeps only the VMM mechanism (`Vm`, `Vcpu`, guest
  memory, and virtual-device substrate).
* The `bootlinux` argument parse and default memory-base selection are shared
  across arches; only the `build_and_start_{rv64,aarch64}` VM-construction tails differ
  (console model, interrupt controller, and vCPU entry-register conventions).
  The guest-visible memory base is patched into the DTB; the host backing pages
  are allocator-chosen by `kvmm` and need not live at the same physical address.
* `read` drains the guest console TX channel. The channel
  (`vdev_vpl011::TxChannel`) is a bounded SPSC FIFO the boot path installs and
  enables per VM; the UART's guest-output path then forwards bytes into it
  verbatim instead of the host kernel log. The device is non-blocking and
  relies on the reader's `poll` (level-triggered on pending output); it does
  not inject a wakeup, so first-byte latency after an idle period is bounded by
  the reader's poll timeout.
* The global `VM_REGISTRY` (used by `/proc/kvmm`) still lives in `kvmm`. VMs
   booted through this device register there via `Vm::register`, so they appear
  in `/proc/kvmm`.

## Future direction

* Add an event-driven console wakeup (`poll` wait queue woken on TX push) if
  the poll-timeout first-byte latency proves too coarse for interactive use.
* Add a KVM-compatible ioctl device (`kvm_device.rs`) alongside the fd-bound
  Linux boot device.
