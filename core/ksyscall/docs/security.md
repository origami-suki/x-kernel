# ksyscall security and reliability

## Overview

`ksyscall` is the first adaptation boundary between the user-space syscall
ABI and kernel resource owners. The main risk sources are:

- user-provided syscall numbers, flags, fds, PIDs, and scalar arguments;
- user-pointer `copyin`/`copyout`;
- wrong owner routing that moves permission or semantic checks to the wrong
  place;
- adapters accidentally holding resource state, blurring the boundary.

## Trust model

```text
userspace syscall arguments
   │ untrusted
   v
ksyscall
   │ validates ABI shape and dispatches
   v
resource owners
   ├─ posix-fs / kvfs
   ├─ kfd_objects
   ├─ kprocess
   ├─ posix-process / kprocess
   └─ other subsystem owners
```

- User-space syscall arguments are untrusted.
- `ksyscall` trusts each owner crate to maintain real resource semantics
  once the call crosses its boundary.
- `ksyscall` must complete ABI-level baseline validation at the syscall
  boundary without duplicating owner-internal invariant checks.

## Unsafe inventory

The crate contains three audited unsafe sites; all carry inline `SAFETY:`
notes. There are no hand-written unsafe traits, FFI, or inline assembly.

| Site | Operation | Invariant |
|---|---|---|
| `sys.rs` (`sethostname`) | stack `[u8; N]` reborrowed as `MaybeUninit<u8>` for copy-from-user | the array is live with trivially initializable bytes; only `buf[..len]` is read after the copy (same pattern as `devfs/nodes/loop.rs`) |
| `task/clone3.rs` | fully initialized `#[repr(C)]` integer struct viewed as `MaybeUninit<u8>` for a versioned in-place user copy | `kargs` is zero-initialized first, so bytes beyond the caller's struct version stay zero; the reinterpretation is size-preserving |
| `time/posix_timer.rs` | read of `sigevent._sigev_un._tid` | guarded by `sigev_notify == SIGEV_THREAD_ID`, the ABI-defined selector for that union arm; the tid is validated positive and owned by the process before use |

All other user-memory access goes through the `posix-types`/`osvm` checked
copy wrappers.

## Core invariants

1. `ksyscall` keeps no long-term resource state.
2. User pointers are accessed only through the existing safe wrapper types.
3. Syscall adapters own ABI-level error-code branches and do not implement
   owner logic beyond their mandate.
4. Adapter directory structure reflects owner boundaries, not historical
   API categories.
5. Helpers involving the current process/thread are called only in
   contexts that guarantee them.
6. Syscall decoding reads only the registers its ABI defines; stale values
   in registers unused by an older ABI must not be trusted as extension
   flags.

## Threat analysis

| ID | Threat | Severity | Trigger | Response |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| T-01 | Bad user pointer fails copyin/copyout | Medium | any wrapped access | All access goes through `UserPtr`/`UserConstPtr` and existing wrappers, propagating `KResult` |
| T-02 | Adapter lands under the wrong owner, blurring boundary responsibilities again | Medium | new syscalls placed by habit | Directories and docs are organized by owner semantics; reviews check routing |
| T-03 | Adapter duplicates an owner state machine, creating a second source of semantics | High | convenience copying | Docs state that `ksyscall` owns no long-term state; ABI adaptation only |
| T-04 | Current-thread/process helpers called in the wrong context | Medium | helper misuse | Reuse `kprocess` constraints; syscall entry maintains the task-context assumption |
| T-05 | Historically misleading directories keep collecting syscalls of the wrong owner | Medium | new additions | This crate-local design doc fixes the `vfs`/`ipc`/`time`/`task` adapter semantics |
| T-06 | `setpriority` authorizes only a process representative and misses target identity | High | per-thread credentials | `PRIO_*` selection and scanning both resolve to concrete tasks; per task, caller euid is compared with target real/effective UID, and priority-raising permission is checked separately |
| T-06a | Unprivileged process rewrites arbitrary task affinity | High | `sched_setaffinity` calling `set_cpumask` on non-current targets | After target resolution, caller euid is compared with target ruid/euid under `check_same_owner` semantics; root (approximating `CAP_SYS_NICE`) may bypass, otherwise `EPERM` |
| T-07 | Unprivileged process renames the host | High | `sethostname` writing the UTS namespace directly | The syscall boundary checks a privileged credential and bounds nodename length and the user buffer access |
| T-08 | Unprivileged process changes power state | High | `reboot` reaching platform power interfaces directly | Privileged credential, Linux magic, and the supported command set are checked |
| T-09 | Unprivileged process shifts the wall clock | High | wall-clock setters updating the realtime association directly | `settimeofday` and `clock_settime` check a privileged credential in the shared setter and reject moving the wall clock before `CLOCK_MONOTONIC` |
| T-10 | `PR_SET_KEEPCAPS` receives an invalid value or bypasses the lock bit | Medium | `ctl.rs` | Values greater than 1 are rejected; `kcred::Cred::keep_caps_enable()` / `keep_caps_disable()` validate the lock bit and commit once through a prepared credential |
| T-11 | `riscv_hwprobe` consumes unvalidated user cpusets/pairs | Medium | bad pointers, oversized masks or pair counts causing huge kernel allocations (DoS) or corrupt ABI results | Pairs stream one by one (`read_vm`/`write_vm`, no bulk `Vec` allocation; an oversized `pair_count` only walks into unmapped pages and returns `EFAULT`); `cpusetsize` is clamped to `cpumask_size()` on both load and write; non-`0`/`WHICH_CPUS` `flags` return `EINVAL`; in value mode an empty intersection of the user cpuset with online CPUs returns `EINVAL`; `cpus == NULL && cpusetsize != 0` returns `EFAULT`; in WHICH_CPUS mode an empty cpuset means all online CPUs, unknown keys write `key=-1,value=0` and clear the output cpuset; key semantics live in the `kcpu` hwprobe helper |
| T-12 | Syscall hot path reads unreliable RISC-V hardware state | Medium | S-mode reads of M-mode CSRs faulting, or capability divergence across CPUs | The source of truth is the FDT-initialized snapshot in `kcpu`; `ksyscall` only aggregates over the selected CPU mask |
| T-13 | `get_robust_list` leaks another process's user addresses | High | target resolution | After resolving the target thread, `kprocess::ptrace::check_read_real_creds_access()` applies the uniform policy: same-thread-group exemption, asymmetric matching of caller real UID/GID against target real/effective/saved IDs, and the euid-0 approximation of `CAP_SYS_PTRACE`; otherwise `EPERM` |
| T-14 | Exec adds privileges despite `no_new_privileges` | High | Future executable credential transitions bypass the thread flag | The current exec path does not grant file-derived privileges; the monotonic thread flag survives fork/clone/exec. Any future set-ID, file-capability or LSM privilege transition must honor it before committing credentials. |

## Known limitations

- `ioctl` first asks `posix-net::handle_net_ioctl` for exact commands, then
  falls back to file `ioctl`. Socket file vtables do not yet implement
  `ioctl`, so SIOC* still hangs on the syscall adapter instead of the Linux
  `sock_ioctl` shape.
- `no_new_privileges` prevents exec from granting new privileges in the current
  credential model; it does not supply capability sets, seccomp enforcement,
  user-namespace isolation, or restrictions on otherwise authorized set-ID calls.
  Capability and seccomp enforcement remain incomplete.

## Audit checklist

- Scheduler policy/parameter queries use the published TID directory and hold
  an owned task reference across the read. They never replace a missing TID
  with a process representative. Output uses `UserPtr` after argument and
  target checks. The existing scheduler setters still need a separate target
  and permission audit; accepting a TID for read access does not authorize
  scheduler state changes.
- cgroup/namespace flags may leave the `ENOSYS` list only when fully
  implemented; adapters do not create a second membership or namespace-view
  state.
- Do any new executable privilege transitions honor the executing thread's
  `no_new_privileges` flag before publishing credentials?
- Does a new syscall implementation only adapt the ABI instead of copying
  an owner state machine?
- Is a new adapter placed near its owner rather than in a historical
  catch-all directory?
- Do all user-pointer accesses go through the existing wrapper types?
- When merging similar syscall paths, are the per-ABI argument counts and
  flags respected separately?
- Is the calling context of current process/thread helpers explicit?
- Do architecture-specific syscalls keep hardware sources of truth in the
  architecture owner instead of ad-hoc probing in the adapter?
- When owner routing changes, are this crate's and the owner's documents
  updated together?
