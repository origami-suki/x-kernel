# ksyscall design

## Purpose

`ksyscall` is the X-Kernel syscall adapter crate. It:

- dispatches on syscall number;
- decodes Linux ABI arguments;
- performs user-pointer `copyin`/`copyout`;
- validates flags, scalars, and struct shape at the syscall boundary;
- forwards calls to the real resource owners.

`ksyscall` owns no long-lived state, invariants, or lifetimes behind the
syscalls; those semantics belong to the respective owner crates.

## Background

Historically some syscall implementations were grouped by API name — for
example `fs/` collected VFS path operations together with `timerfd`,
`eventfd`, and `pidfd`, which do not share a resource boundary. The current
refactoring principles are:

- `ksyscall` keeps adapters only;
- resource semantics return to their owners;
- directory organization follows owner semantics, not historical API
  categories.

## Design principles

1. `ksyscall` owns ABI adaptation only, never resource state.
2. A syscall's directory placement follows the resource owner it finally
   routes to.
3. `copyin`/`copyout`, flag validation, and compat branches belong to the
   adapter layer.
4. State machines, invariants, and lifetimes of resource objects stay in
   owner crates.
5. Syscalls with similar names but different owners are not merged into one
   directory.
6. Each syscall number decodes exactly the argument count its ABI defines;
   registers left unused by older ABIs must not be read as extension flags.
7. When a process-control syscall replaces the user execution context, it
   must build a fresh register state for the target architecture's ELF
   entry ABI instead of inheriting the old syscall argument registers.
   After `execve` loads the new image it calls
   `UserContext::reset_for_exec()` before rebuilding IP/SP/TLS, zeroing all
   general registers and syscall-restart state; otherwise the x86_64 static
   glibc entry would see a stale `rdx` (old `envp`, interpreted as
   `rtld_fini` → SIGSEGV on exit), and aarch64 `x2` / riscv/loongarch64
   `a2` would keep the old `envp`.

## Owner alignment

- `vfs/`: path and VFS syscalls; owners in `posix-fs` / `kvfs`.
- `ioctl`: `dispatch.rs` first asks `posix-net::handle_net_ioctl` for its
  exact SIOC* list, then falls back to `posix-fs::sys_ioctl`. It does not
  filter by the `0x89xx` ioctl type space; socket file vtables do not yet
  override `ioctl`.
- `ipc/pipe.rs`: `pipe2`; owner `kfd_objects::PipeObject`.
- `ipc/eventfd.rs`: `eventfd2`; owner `kfd_objects::EventFd`.
- `sys.rs`: `sethostname` routes to the current UTS namespace. `reboot`
  validates the Linux magic/command then routes to `khal::power` endpoints:
  `HALT` takes `halt()` (stop all CPUs, keep power), `POWER_OFF` takes
  `power_off()` (platform power removal); both stop other CPUs through the
  SMP-stop hook first, while fs-sync/device-shutdown housekeeping is left
  to a future orderly-shutdown supervisor; `SW_SUSPEND` takes
  `suspend_to_ram()` (non-terminal: S3 via the platform sleep proxy, or a
  platform error back to the caller when absent/refused).
- `arch/`: architecture-specific system-info/control adapters (`arch/mod.rs`
  organizes per-architecture submodules via `cfg`, `lib.rs` declares the
  top-level `mod arch;`, and `sys.rs` only re-exports `crate::arch::*`),
  avoiding stray top-level per-architecture files.
  - riscv64 `riscv_hwprobe` parses the Linux `struct riscv_hwprobe`, user
    cpusets, and `RISCV_HWPROBE_WHICH_CPUS`, then queries `kcpu` for each
    present logical CPU's RISC-V capability snapshot; `ksyscall` only does
    ABI copyin/copyout and cpuset boundary handling, while key semantics,
    aggregation, and matching live in `kcpu`'s hwprobe helper.
  - riscv64 `riscv_flush_icache` reads the third argument `flags` (Linux
    ABI is 64-bit: kernel `uintptr_t`, libc `unsigned long`, so it is
    handled as `usize` with all 64 bits reserved-checked — note the
    difference from `riscv_hwprobe`'s 32-bit `unsigned int flags`):
    `SYS_RISCV_FLUSH_ICACHE_LOCAL` flushes only this hart
    (`karch::flush_icache_all_local()`, a single `fence.i`), other reserved
    bits return `EINVAL`; without LOCAL, `karch::flush_icache_all()`
    broadcasts an IPI to all harts so self-modifying code stays visible
    after task migration.
- `time/timerfd.rs`: `timerfd_*`; owner `kfd_objects::TimerFd`.
- `time/queries.rs`: `time` / `clock_gettime` / `gettimeofday` /
  `clock_getres` / `clock_settime` / `settimeofday`; owners in `khal` clock
  sources, `ktime` realtime association (including `set_realtime`), and
  `kprocess` CPU-time queries.
- `time/sleep.rs`: `nanosleep` / `clock_nanosleep`; owners in the `ktask`
  sleep runtime and `khal` clock queries.
- `time/itimer.rs`: `getitimer` / `setitimer`; owner `ProcessTimerManager`
  legacy interval-timer state.
- `time/posix_timer.rs`: `timer_create` / `timer_gettime` / `timer_settime`
  / `timer_delete` / `timer_getoverrun`; owners in `ProcessTimerManager`
  POSIX timer state and the `kprocess` timer delivery runtime.
- `io_mpx/`: `select` / `pselect6` / `poll` / `ppoll` / `epoll_*`; owners
  in `kfd_objects::Epoll` and the generic `FileLike` poll interface.
- `task/pidfd.rs`: `pidfd_*`; owner `kprocess::PidFd`.
- `task/credentials.rs`: `get*id` / `set*id` / `getgroups` / `setgroups`;
  owners in `kprocess` current-credential helpers and the `kcred` model.
- `task/ctl.rs`: `prctl` `PR_GET_KEEPCAPS` / `PR_SET_KEEPCAPS`; owners in
  the `kprocess` credential publication path and `kcred` securebits.
- `task/ids.rs`: `getpid` / `getppid`; owner `kprocess` current thread and
  parent relations.
- `task/job.rs`: `getsid` / `setsid` / `getpgid` / `getpgrp` / `setpgid`;
  owner `kprocess` process-group and session state.
- `task/thread.rs`: `gettid` / `set_tid_address` / `arch_prctl`; owners in
  `kprocess` current-thread state and architecture thread context.
- `task/signal.rs`: `rt_sigprocmask` / `rt_sigaction` / `rt_sigpending` /
  `kill` / `tkill` / `tgkill` / `rt_sigqueueinfo` / `rt_tgsigqueueinfo` /
  `rt_sigreturn` / `rt_sigtimedwait` / `rt_sigsuspend` / `sigaltstack` /
  `signalfd4`; owners in `kprocess` per-thread signal state, the `ksignal`
  signal model, and `kfd_objects::Signalfd`.
- `task/cpu_time.rs`: `times`; owners in `kprocess` process CPU-time
  accounting and `khal` clock queries.
- `task/rusage.rs`: `getrusage`; owner `kprocess` CPU-time sampling state.
- `task/limits.rs`: `getrlimit` / `setrlimit` / `prlimit64`; owner the
  process resource/rlimit state held by `kprocess::ProcessRuntime`.
- `task/umask.rs`: `umask`; owner the `kprocess::ProcessRuntime` file
  creation mask.
- `task/sched.rs`: `sched_yield` / `sched_*affinity` / `sched_*scheduler` /
  `getcpu` / `getpriority` / `setpriority`; owners in `ktask` scheduling
  interfaces, `kprocess` process/thread state, and `khal` CPU queries.
  `PRIO_PROCESS` selects one task by TID; `PRIO_PGRP` and `PRIO_USER`
  iterate every published task — a process representative thread must not
  stand in for per-thread nice or real UID. `setpriority` compares the
  caller's effective UID with the target's real/effective UIDs; root
  currently approximates `CAP_SYS_NICE`, and unprivileged callers cannot
  lower nice (raise priority). `sched_setaffinity` requires the same
  caller-euid vs target ruid/euid match or root (`CAP_SYS_NICE`
  approximation); the error order is ESRCH → EPERM → EINVAL (empty mask);
  `ktask::set_task_affinity` then migrates a queued task off its CPU,
  only changes the mask when no CPU is occupied, and returns EBUSY when
  the task cannot migrate.
- `sync/futex.rs`: `futex` / `get_robust_list` / `set_robust_list`;
  compound operations (`REQUEUE` / `CMP_REQUEUE` / `WAKE_OP`) resolve both
  keys under a single `address_space` lock; the robust-list walk lives in
  `posix/process`.

## Container-related adapters

Until unified user-namespace capability authorization exists, `clone` /
`clone3` return `ENOSYS` for `CLONE_NEWCGROUP` instead of improvising
namespace-creation permission with UID checks.

`PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS` validates the Linux argument contract and permanently
sets the calling `Thread`'s flag; `PR_GET_NO_NEW_PRIVS` reads that flag.
Fork and thread clone copy it from the calling thread, while exec preserves it.
Existing sibling threads are unaffected. No privilege check is required to set it.
The current exec path preserves effective UID/GID and supplementary groups;
it only resets saved/filesystem IDs to effective IDs and clears keep-capabilities.
It does not derive privileges from setuid/setgid file bits, file capabilities,
or LSM transitions, so exec cannot add privileges with the flag set.
Future file-based privilege transitions must consult the executing thread's
flag before changing credentials. This does not implement seccomp or full
capability enforcement, and it does not prohibit authorized non-exec set-ID calls.
The contract follows the
[Linux no-new-privileges documentation](https://docs.kernel.org/userspace-api/no_new_privs.html).

## Non-goals

`ksyscall` does not:

- keep internal state of fd-backed objects;
- hold shared objects such as `ProcessRuntime`, address spaces, or VFS
  nodes;
- implement path resolution, signal state machines, timer state machines,
  or pipe buffer behavior;
- provide a convenient catch-all owner abstraction.
