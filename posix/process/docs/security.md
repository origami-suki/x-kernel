# posix-process — Security and reliability

## Scope, trust and assets

The analysis covers all three source files and their optional TEE/TIPC paths.
Protected assets are the current thread's identity, saved user context, address
space ownership, runtime handles and parent-visible completion. `kprocess`
provides identity/publication and owner-slot synchronization, `memspace` handles
faults/mappings, `kuaccess`/`osvm` perform fault-aware user access, and `kfutex`
resolves futex keys. This crate orders those operations; it does not validate
executable formats or maintain process registries itself.

## External boundaries and validation

`spawn_init_process(args, envs, ...)` passes path/argv/envp to `ExecRequest` and
`load_user_app_request`; filesystem resolution and executable validation belong
to those providers. Missing argv or bootstrap failures panic.
`run_user_thread_loop` receives architecture trap results and the saved user
context. It uses structured MM fault outcomes and signal actions, not raw
user-supplied exception interpretations.

`exit_robust_list` reads the registered userspace head and linked nodes through
`read_vm`; failed reads stop the walk. Pointer low-bit tags distinguish PI
entries, which are skipped. The walk stops at the sentinel or
`ROBUST_LIST_LIMIT`, then separately handles a nonnull non-PI pending entry.
`dispatch_irq_futex_death` checks signed address addition/conversion and uses
fault-aware atomic access. It changes only a word whose owner TID matches; the
pending unlocked-word case can wake a waiter without changing ownership.
`do_exit` writes zero to the userspace `clear_child_tid` pointer and wakes only
if the write and futex-key resolution succeed. These pointers are untrusted;
registration is not proof that their pages remain accessible.

## Unsafe inventory and memory invariants

| Location | Operation and necessary invariant | Guard/provider |
|---|---|---|
| `src/runtime.rs`, `run_user_thread_loop` (LoongArch only) | Calls unsafe `UserContext::emulate_unaligned`; the saved context must still describe the faulting misaligned instruction. | Only reached for the `Misaligned` exception returned by that context's `run`; matches its adjacent SAFETY explanation. |
| `src/runtime.rs`, `exit_robust_list` | Forms a raw address of the embedded list sentinel without loading the field. | The pointer is the registered robust-list head; the address is used only for termination comparison, and actual contents are copied with `read_vm`, as stated by the SAFETY comment. |

There is no direct FFI declaration or inline assembly in this crate. Architecture
and userspace access contracts remain in their providers. The task's PID handle
and installed `Thread` must agree before publication. Last-thread runtime owners
must be detached before parent-visible completion so zombie identity cannot keep
files, mounts or active mm ownership alive.

## Thread safety

Current-thread helpers require a user runtime; they are not kernel-task APIs.
The loop exclusively updates its supplied user context. Shared process state is
protected by `kprocess`, and atomic futex words may change concurrently in
userspace. No local lock makes the whole robust list immutable: each read is a
snapshot and traversal is bounded. Resource destruction and parent notification
must retain the ordering described in the design document.

## Threats

| ID | Threat / asset | Severity | Trigger | Existing response and residual risk |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| T-01 | Invalid or cyclic robust list consumes kernel work or touches invalid memory. | Medium | An exiting thread supplies malformed nodes or concurrent changes. | Fault-aware reads stop on error and `ROBUST_LIST_LIMIT` bounds traversal; PI entries are skipped and their cleanup is not implemented here. |
| T-02 | Futex cleanup changes another owner's lock word. | High | A word is reused or ownership changes during exit. | Compare owner TID, then compare-exchange; retry when the observed word changes. Key resolution is delegated to `kfutex`. |
| T-03 | Faulting file mappings deliver the wrong signal. | Medium | A file-backed access is beyond the backing object's valid extent. | Map `PageFaultOutcome::BusError` to SIGBUS; MM owns the classification. |
| T-04 | Process completion exposes still-held resources. | Medium | Last-thread teardown notifies a waiter before detach. | Release mm/files/fs/ns and IPC state before `complete_process_exit`; logged cleanup failures remain a diagnostic limitation. |
| T-05 | Bootstrap input prevents system startup. | Medium | Empty argv or resolution/loading/publication failure. | Fail-stop panic with context; bootstrap recovery is intentionally not provided. |
| T-06 | Pending work is delayed before userspace reentry. | Medium | A timer/scheduler interrupt arrives after the normal signal check. | Clear old interrupt state before timer polling and check a newly set flag before reentry; CPU kick behavior is provided by the task layer. |

## Failure-mode analysis

| ID | Failure mode | Cause | Local effect | System effect | Severity (1–4) | Controls |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| F-01 | Robust-list read/update fails | Malformed or concurrently changed user list | Remaining nodes may not be recovered | User waiters may remain blocked | 3 | Stop invalid traversal; process exit still progresses. |
| F-02 | Resource detach returns an error | Provider cleanup error | Cleanup may be incomplete | Resource lifetime or observer semantics can degrade | 2 | Log per-owner errors and continue the remaining teardown. |
| F-03 | Init construction fails | Missing bootstrap prerequisites or invalid image | PID 1 never runs | Boot stops | 1 | Explicit assertions/expect messages identify the failed stage. |
| F-04 | Group-exit signal delivery races thread exit | Concurrent sibling termination | A sibling may disappear | Best-effort group termination continues | 3 | Iterate currently published siblings and tolerate delivery errors. |

## Privacy and limitations

Arguments/environment and robust-list contents are userspace data. Bootstrap
passes them to loading/runtime metadata; fault logs include executable path,
PID and instruction/stack/fault addresses, which require trusted log access.
There is no local redaction or core-file generation. Stop and CoreDump actions
are simplified, and PI robust-futex cleanup is skipped.

## Audit checklist

- Keep identity/runtime construction before publication and activation.
- Preserve robust-list limits, fault-aware accesses and owner-TID atomic checks.
- Preserve mm/files/fs/ns detach before process completion.
- Check optional TEE/TIPC teardown in its configured build.
- Keep the LoongArch context precondition tied to the actual trap result.
- Verify fault signal mapping and the post-timer interrupt recheck when changing the loop.
